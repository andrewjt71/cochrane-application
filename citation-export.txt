It remains unclear what type of advice is best.Objectives: To assess the effects of different types of dietary advice for women with GDM for improving health outcomes for women and babies.Search methods: We searched Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth's Trials Register (8 March 2016), PSANZ's Trials Registry (22 March 2016) and reference lists of retrieved studies.Selection criteria: Randomised controlled trials comparing the effects of different types of dietary advice for women with GDM.Data collection and analysis: Two authors independently assessed study eligibility, risk of bias, and extracted data. Evidence quality for two comparisons was assessed using GRADE, for primary outcomes for the mother: hypertensive disorders of pregnancy; caesarean section; type 2 diabetes mellitus; and child: large-for-gestational age; perinatal mortality; neonatal mortality or morbidity composite; neurosensory disability; secondary outcomes for the mother: induction of labour; perineal trauma; postnatal depression; postnatal weight retention or return to pre-pregnancy weight; and child: hypoglycaemia; childhood/adulthood adiposity; childhood/adulthood type 2 diabetes mellitus.Main results: In this update, we included 19 trials randomising 1398 women with GDM, at an overall unclear to moderate risk of bias (10 comparisons). For outcomes assessed using GRADE, downgrading was based on study limitations, imprecision and inconsistency. Where no findings are reported below for primary outcomes or pre-specified GRADE outcomes, no data were provided by included trials. Primary outcomes Low-moderate glycaemic index (GI) versus moderate-high GI diet (four trials): no clear differences observed for: large-for-gestational age (risk ratio (RR) 0.71, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.22 to 2.34; two trials, 89 infants; low-quality evidence); severe hypertension or pre-eclampsia (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.07 to 15.86; one trial, 95 women; very low-quality evidence); eclampsia (RR 0.34, 95% CI 0.01 to 8.14; one trial, 83 women; very low-quality evidence) or caesarean section (RR 0.66, 95% CI 0.29 to 1.47; one trial, 63 women; low-quality evidence). Energy-restricted versus no energy-restricted diet (three trials): no clear differences seen for: large-for-gestational age (RR 1.17, 95% CI 0.65 to 2.12; one trial, 123 infants; low-quality evidence); perinatal mortality (no events; two trials, 423 infants; low-quality evidence); pre-eclampsia (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.51 to 1.97; one trial, 117 women; low-quality evidence); or caesarean section (RR 1.12, 95% CI 0.80 to 1.56; two trials, 420 women; low-quality evidence). DASH (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension) diet versus control diet (three trials): no clear differences observed for: pre-eclampsia (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.31 to 3.26; three trials, 136 women); however there were fewer caesarean sections in the DASH diet group (RR 0.53, 95% CI 0.37 to 0.76; two trials, 86 women). Low-carbohydrate versus high-carbohydrate diet (two trials): no clear differences seen for: large-for-gestational age (RR 0.51, 95% CI 0.13 to 1.95; one trial, 149 infants); perinatal mortality (RR 3.00, 95% CI 0.12 to 72.49; one trial, 150 infants); maternal hypertension (RR 0.40, 95% CI 0.13 to 1.22; one trial, 150 women); or caesarean section (RR 1.29, 95% CI 0.84 to 1.99; two trials, 179 women). High unsaturated fat versus low unsaturated fat diet (two trials): no clear differences observed for: large-for-gestational age (RR 0.54, 95% CI 0.21 to 1.37; one trial, 27 infants); pre-eclampsia (no cases; one trial, 27 women); hypertension in pregnancy (RR 0.54, 95% CI 0.06 to 5.26; one trial, 27 women); caesarean section (RR 1.08, 95% CI 0.07 to 15.50; one trial, 27 women); diabetes at one to two weeks (RR 2.00, 95% CI 0.45 to 8.94; one trial, 24 women) or four to 13 months postpartum (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.10 to 9.61; one trial, six women). Low-GI versus high-fibre moderate-GI diet (one trial): no clear differences seen for: large-for-gestational age (RR 2.87, 95% CI 0.61 to 13.50; 92 infants); caesarean section (RR 1.91, 95% CI 0.91 to 4.03; 92 women); or type 2 diabetes at three months postpartum (RR 0.76, 95% CI 0.11 to 5.01; 58 women). Diet recommendation plus diet-related behavioural advice versus diet recommendation only (one trial): no clear differences observed for: large-for-gestational age (RR 0.73, 95% CI 0.25 to 2.14; 99 infants); or caesarean section (RR 0.78, 95% CI 0.38 to 1.62; 99 women). Soy protein-enriched versus no soy protein diet (one trial): no clear differences seen for: pre-eclampsia (RR 2.00, 95% CI 0.19 to 21.03; 68 women); or caesarean section (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.57 to 1.77; 68 women). High-fibre versus standard-fibre diet (one trial): no primary outcomes reported. Ethnic-specific versus standard healthy diet (one trial): no clear differences observed for: large-for-gestational age (RR 0.14, 95% CI 0.01 to 2.45; 20 infants); neonatal composite adverse outcome (no events; 20 infants); gestational hypertension (RR 0.33, 95% CI 0.02 to 7.32; 20 women); or caesarean birth (RR 1.20, 95% CI 0.54 to 2.67; 20 women). Secondary outcomesFor secondary outcomes assessed using GRADE no differences were observed: between a low-moderate and moderate-high GI diet for induction of labour (RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.33 to 2.34; one trial, 63 women; low-quality evidence); or an energy-restricted and no energy-restricted diet for induction of labour (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.68 to 1.53; one trial, 114 women, low-quality evidence) and neonatal hypoglycaemia (average RR 1.06, 95% CI 0.48 to 2.32; two trials, 408 infants; very low-quality evidence).Few other clear differences were observed for reported outcomes. Longer-term health outcomes and health services use and costs were largely not reported.Authors' conclusions: Evidence from 19 trials assessing different types of dietary advice for women with GDM suggests no clear differences for primary outcomes and secondary outcomes assessed using GRADE, except for a possible reduction in caesarean section for women receiving a DASH diet compared with a control diet. Few differences were observed for secondary outcomes.Current evidence is limited by the small number of trials in each comparison, small sample sizes, and variable methodological quality. More evidence is needed to assess the effects of different types of dietary advice for women with GDM. Future trials should be adequately powered to evaluate short- and long-term outcomes.US: http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD009275.pub3/abstractRecord #2 of 271ID: CD001903AU: Martin KirstyAU: Jackson Cerian FAU: Levy Robert GAU: Cooper Paul NTI: Ketogenic diet and other dietary treatments for epilepsySO: Cochrane Database of Systematic ReviewsYR: 2016NO: 2PB: John Wiley & Sons, LtdKY: Diet, Carbohydrate-Restricted [methods];Dietary Carbohydrates [administration & dosage];Dietary Fats [administration & dosage];Epilepsy [diet therapy];Intention to Treat Analysis;Ketogenic Diet [methods];Prospective Studies;Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic;Retrospective Studies;Adolescent[checkword];Child[checkword];Humans[checkword]CC: EPILEPSYDOI: 10.1002/14651858.CD001903.pub3AB: Background: The ketogenic diet (KD), being high in fat and low in carbohydrates, has been suggested to reduce seizure frequency. It is currently used mainly for children who continue to have seizures despite treatment with antiepileptic drugs. Recently, there has been interest in less restrictive KDs including the modified Atkins diet (MAD) and the use of these diets has extended into adult practice.Objectives: To review the evidence for efficacy and tolerability from randomised controlled trials regarding the effects of KD and similar diets.Search methods: We searched the Cochrane Epilepsy Group's Specialized Register (30 March 2015), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) via the Cochrane Register of Studies Online (CRSO, 30 March 2015), MEDLINE (Ovid, 30 March 2015), ClinicalTrials.gov (30 March 2015) and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP, 30 March 2015). We imposed no language restrictions. We checked the reference lists of retrieved studies for additional reports of relevant studies.Selection criteria: Studies of KDs and similar diets for people with epilepsy.Data collection and analysis: Two review authors independently applied pre-defined criteria to extract data and assessed study quality.Main results: We identified seven randomised controlled trials that generated eight publications.All trials applied an intention-to-treat analysis with varied randomisation methods. The seven studies recruited 427 children and adolescents and no adults. We could not conduct a meta-analysis due to the heterogeneity of the studies.Reported rates of seizure freedom reached as high as 55% in a 4 : 1 KD group after three months and reported rates of seizure reduction reached as high as 85% in a 4 : 1 KD group after three months.One trial found no significant difference between the fasting-onset and gradual-onset KD for rates of seizure freedom and reported a greater rate of seizure reduction in the gradual-onset KD group.Studies assessing the efficacy of the MAD reported seizure freedom rates of up to 10% and seizure reduction rates of up to 60%. One study compared the MAD to a 4 : 1 KD, but did not report rates of seizure freedom or seizure reduction.Adverse effects were fairly consistent across different dietary interventions. The most commonly reported adverse effects were gastrointestinal syndromes. It was common that adverse effects were the reason for participants dropping out of trials. Other reasons for drop-out included lack of efficacy and non-acceptance of the diet.Although there was some evidence for greater antiepileptic efficacy for a 4 : 1 KD over lower ratios, the 4 : 1 KD was consistently associated with more adverse effects.No studies assessed the effect of dietary interventions on quality of life, or cognitive or behavioural functioning.Authors' conclusions: The randomised controlled trials discussed in this review show promising results for the use of KDs in epilepsy. However, the limited number of studies, small sample sizes and a sole paediatric population resulted in a poor overall quality of evidence.There were adverse effects within all of the studies and for all KD variations, such as short-term gastrointestinal-related disturbances, to longer-term cardiovascular complications. Attrition rates remained a problem with all KDs and across all studies, reasons for this being lack of observed efficacy and dietary tolerance.There was a lack of evidence to support the clinical use of KD in adults with epilepsy, therefore, further research would be of benefit.Other more palatable but related diets, such as the MAD ketogenic diet, may have a similar effect on seizure control as classical KD but this assumption requires more investigation. For people who have medically intractable epilepsy or people who are not suitable for surgical intervention, a KD remains a valid option; however, further research is required.US: http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD001903.pub3/abstractRecord #3 of 271ID: CD003054AU: Orozco Leonardo JAU: Buchleitner Ana MariaAU: Gimenez-Perez GabrielAU: Roqué i Figuls MartaAU: Richter BerndAU: Mauricio DidacTI: Exercise or exercise and diet for preventing type 2 diabetes mellitusSO: Cochrane Database of Systematic ReviewsYR: 2008NO: 3PB: John Wiley & Sons, LtdKY: Diet;Exercise;Combined Modality Therapy [methods];Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2 [prevention & control];Diet, Diabetic;Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic;Humans[checkword]CC: ENDOCDOI: 10.1002/14651858.CD003054.pub3AB: Background: The incidence of type 2 diabetes is associated with the 'Westernised lifestyle', mainly in terms of dietary habits and physical activity. Thus an intensive diet and exercise intervention might prevent or delay the appearance of diabetes in persons at high risk.Objectives: To assess the effects of exercise or exercise and diet for preventing type 2 diabetes mellitus.Search methods: We searched The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, LILACS, SocioFile, databases of ongoing trials and reference lists of relevant reviews.Selection criteria: Studies were included if they were randomised controlled trials of exercise and diet interventions of at least six month duration and reported diabetes incidence in people at risk for type 2 diabetes.Data collection and analysis: Two authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. Study authors were contacted to obtain missing data. Data on diabetes incidence and secondary outcomes were analysed by means of random-effects meta-analysis.Main results: We included eight trials that had an exercise plus diet (2241 participants) and a standard recommendation arm (2509 participants). Two studies had a diet only (167 participants) and exercise only arm (178 participants). Study duration ranged from one to six years. Overall, exercise plus diet interventions reduced the risk of diabetes compared with standard recommendations (RR 0.63, 95% CI 0.49 to 0.79). This had also favourable effects on weight and body mass index reduction, waist-to-hip ratio and waist circumference. However, statistical heterogeneity was very high for these outcomes. Exercise and diet interventions had a very modest effect on blood lipids. However, this intervention improved systolic and diastolic blood pressure levels (weighted mean difference -4 mmHg, 95% CI -5 to -2 and -2 mmHg, 95% CI -3 to -1, respectively). No statistical significant effects on diabetes incidence were observed when comparing exercise only interventions either with standard recommendations or with diet only interventions. No study reported relevant data on diabetes and cardiovascular related morbidity, mortality and quality of life.Authors' conclusions: Interventions aimed at increasing exercise combined with diet are able to decrease the incidence of type 2 diabetes mellitus in high risk groups (people with impaired glucose tolerance or the metabolic syndrome). There is a need for studies exploring exercise only interventions and studies exploring the effect of exercise and diet on quality of life, morbidity and mortality, with special focus on cardiovascular outcomes.US: http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD003054.pub3/abstractRecord #4 of 271ID: CD007145AU: Muktabhant BenjaAU: Lawrie Theresa AAU: Lumbiganon PisakeAU: Laopaiboon MalineeTI: Diet or exercise, or both, for preventing excessive weight gain in pregnancySO: Cochrane Database of Systematic ReviewsYR: 2015NO: 6PB: John Wiley & Sons, LtdKY: Diet;Exercise;Weight Gain;Counseling;Overweight [complications] [prevention & control];Pregnancy Complications [prevention & control];Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic;Female[checkword];Humans[checkword];Infant, Newborn[checkword];Pregnancy[checkword]CC: PREGDOI: 10.1002/14651858.CD007145.pub3AB: Background: This is an update of a Cochrane review first published in 2012, Issue 4. Excessive weight gain during pregnancy is associated with poor maternal and neonatal outcomes including gestational diabetes, hypertension, caesarean section, macrosomia, and stillbirth. Diet or exercise interventions, or both, may reduce excessive gestational weight gain (GWG) and associated poor outcomes; however, evidence from the original review was inconclusive.Objectives: To evaluate the effectiveness of diet or exercise, or both, interventions for preventing excessive weight gain during pregnancy and associated pregnancy complications.Search methods: We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (5 November 2014), contacted investigators of the previously identified ongoing studies and scanned reference lists of retrieved studies.Selection criteria: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of diet or exercise, or both, interventions for preventing excessive weight gain in pregnancy.Data collection and analysis: Two review authors independently assessed trials for inclusion and risk of bias, extracted data and checked them for accuracy. We organised RCTs according to the type of interventions and pooled data using the random-effects model in the Review Manager software. We also performed subgroup analyses according to the initial risk of adverse effects related to poor weight control. We performed sensitivity analysis to assess the robustness of the findings.Main results: We included 65 RCTs, out of which 49 RCTs involving 11,444 women contributed data to quantitative meta-analysis. Twenty studies were at moderate-to-high risk of bias. Study interventions involved mainly diet only, exercise only, and combined diet and exercise interventions, usually compared with standard care. Study methods varied widely; therefore, we estimated the average effect across studies and performed sensitivity analysis, where appropriate, by excluding outliers and studies at high risk of bias.Diet or exercise, or both, interventions reduced the risk of excessive GWG on average by 20% overall (average risk ratio (RR) 0.80, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.73 to 0.87; participants = 7096; studies = 24; I² = 52%). This estimate was robust to sensitivity analysis, which reduced heterogeneity, therefore we graded this evidence as high-quality. Interventions involving low glycaemic load diets, supervised or unsupervised exercise only, or diet and exercise combined all led to similar reductions in the number of women gaining excessive weight in pregnancy.Women receiving diet or exercise, or both interventions were more likely to experience low GWG than those in control groups (average RR 1.14, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.27; participants = 4422; studies = 11; I² = 3%; moderate-quality evidence). We found no difference between intervention and control groups with regard to pre-eclampsia (RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.77 to 1.16; participants = 5330; studies = 15; I² = 0%; high-quality evidence); however, maternal hypertension (not a pre-specified outcome) was reduced in the intervention group compared with the control group overall (average RR 0.70, 95% CI 0.51 to 0.96; participants = 5162; studies = 11; I² = 43%; low-quality evidence).There was no clear difference between groups with regard to caesarean delivery overall (RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.03; participants = 7534; studies = 28; I² = 9%; high-quality evidence); although the effect estimate suggested a small difference (5%) in favour of the interventions. In addition, for combined diet and exercise counselling interventions there was a 13% (-1% to 25%) reduction in this outcome (borderline statistical significance).We found no difference between groups with regard to preterm birth overall (average RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.68 to 1.22; participants = 5923; studies = 16; I² = 16%; moderate-quality evidence); however limited evidence suggested that these effect estimates may differ according to the types of interventions, with a trend towards an increased risk for exercise-only interventions.We found no clear difference between intervention and control groups with regard to infant macrosomia (average RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.86 to 1.02; participants = 8598; studies = 27; I² = 0%; high-quality evidence), although the effect estimate suggested a small difference (7% reduction) in favour of the intervention group. The largest effect size occurred in the supervised exercise-only intervention group (RR 0.81, 95% CI 0.64 to 1.02; participants = 2445; studies = 7; I² = 0%), which approached statistical significance (P = 0.07). Furthermore, in subgroup analysis by risk, high-risk women (overweight or obese women, or women with or at risk of gestational diabetes) receiving combined diet and exercise counselling interventions experienced a 15% reduced risk of infant macrosomia (average RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.73 to 1.00; participants = 3252; studies = nine; I² = 0; P = 0.05; moderate-quality evidence)There were no differences in the risk of poor neonatal outcomes including shoulder dystocia, neonatal hypoglycaemia, hyperbilirubinaemia, or birth trauma (all moderate-quality evidence) between intervention and control groups; however, infants of high-risk women had a reduced risk of respiratory distress syndrome if their mothers were in the intervention group (RR 0.47, 95% CI 0.26 to 0.85; participants = 2256; studies = two; I² = 0%; moderate-quality evidence).Authors' conclusions: High-quality evidence indicates that diet or exercise, or both, during pregnancy can reduce the risk of excessive GWG. Other benefits may include a lower risk of caesarean delivery, macrosomia, and neonatal respiratory morbidity, particularly for high-risk women receiving combined diet and exercise interventions. Maternal hypertension may also be reduced. Exercise appears to be an important part of controlling weight gain in pregnancy and more research is needed to establish safe guidelines. Most included studies were carried out in developed countries and it is not clear whether these results are widely applicable to lower income settings.US: http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD007145.pub3/abstractRecord #5 of 271ID: CD010443AU: Bain EmilyAU: Crane MorvenAU: Tieu JoannaAU: Han ShanshanAU: Crowther Caroline AAU: Middleton PhilippaTI: Diet and exercise interventions for preventing gestational diabetes mellitusSO: Cochrane Database of Systematic ReviewsYR: 2015NO: 4PB: John Wiley & Sons, LtdKY: Diet;Exercise;Cesarean Section [statistics & numerical data];Diabetes, Gestational [prevention & control];Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic;Female[checkword];Humans[checkword];Pregnancy[checkword]CC: PREGDOI: 10.1002/14651858.CD010443.pub2AB: Background: Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is associated with a wide range of adverse health consequences for women and their babies in the short and long term. With an increasing prevalence of GDM worldwide, there is an urgent need to assess strategies for GDM prevention, such as combined diet and exercise interventions.Objectives: To assess the effects of combined diet and exercise interventions for preventing GDM and associated adverse health consequences for women and their babies.Search methods: We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (11 February 2014) and reference lists of retrieved studies. We updated the search in February 2015 but these results have not yet been incorporated and are awaiting classification.Selection criteria: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and cluster-RCTs assessing the effects of interventions that included diet and exercise components. We included studies where combined diet and exercise interventions were compared with no intervention (i.e. standard care).We planned to also compare diet and exercise interventions with alternative diet and/or exercise interventions but no trials were identified for this comparison.Data collection and analysis: Two review authors independently assessed study eligibility, extracted data and assessed the risk of bias of the included studies. Data were checked for accuracy.Main results: We included 13 randomised controlled trials (involving 4983 women and their babies). We assessed the included trials as being of moderate risk of bias overall.When comparing women receiving a diet and exercise intervention with those receiving no intervention, there was no clear difference in the risk of developing GDM (average risk ratio (RR) 0.92, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.68 to 1.23; 11 trials, 3744 women), caesarean section (RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.83 to 1.01; seven trials, 3246 women), or large-for-gestational age (RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.77 to 1.05; 2950 infants). Only one trial reported on perinatal mortality, and found no clear difference in the risk of stillbirth (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.29 to 3.42; 2202 fetuses) or neonatal death (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.06 to 15.85; 2202 neonates).Very few differences were shown between groups for the review's secondary outcomes, including for induction of labour, perineal trauma, pre-eclampsia, postpartum haemorrhage and infection, macrosomia, birthweight, small-for-gestational age, ponderal index, neonatal hypoglycaemia requiring treatment, hyperbilirubinaemia requiring treatment, shoulder dystocia, bone fracture or nerve palsy. Women receiving a combined diet and exercise intervention were, however, found to have a reduced risk of preterm birth compared with women receiving no intervention (RR 0.71, 95% CI 0.55 to 0.93; five trials, 2713 women).A trend towards reduced weight gain during pregnancy was shown for women receiving the combined diet and exercise intervention (mean difference (MD) -0.76 kg, 95% CI -1.55 to 0.03; eight trials, 2707 women; P = 0.06, random-effects); but no clear difference in postnatal weight retention was observed overall.In relation to adherence to the interventions, a number of trials that reported on behaviour modifications showed benefits in diet- (5/8 trials) and physical activity- (4/8 trials) related behaviours for women receiving the combined diet and exercise intervention, compared with women receiving no intervention; however there was notable variation across trials in outcomes measured and results observed. Only two trials reported on well-being and quality of life of women, and did not observe differences between groups for these outcomes.Very few trials reported on outcomes relating to the use of health services, although one trial suggested a reduced length of antenatal hospital stay for women receiving a combined diet and exercise intervention (MD -0.27 days, 95% CI -0.49 to -0.05; 2153 women).No information was available on outcomes for the infant as a child or adult, or for most longer-term outcomes for the mother.Authors' conclusions: There are limitations associated with the available RCT evidence on the effects of combined diet and exercise interventions during pregnancy for preventing GDM. Results from 13 RCTs (of moderate quality) suggest no clear difference in the risk of developing GDM for women receiving a combined diet and exercise intervention compared with women receiving no intervention. However, the ability to draw firm conclusions was limited by variations in the quality of trials, characteristics of the interventions and populations assessed, and outcome definitions between trials.Based on the data currently available, conclusive evidence is not available to guide practice. Further large, well-designed RCTs, addressing the limitations of previous studies, are needed to assess the effects of combined interventions on preventing GDM and other relevant pregnancy outcomes including caesarean birth, large-for-gestational age and perinatal mortality. Health service utilisation and costs, and longer-term outcomes for mothers and their babies should be included. We identified another 16 trials which are ongoing and we will consider these for inclusion in the next update of this review.[Note: The 28 records in ‘Studies awaiting classification’ may alter the conclusions of the review once assessed].US: http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD010443.pub2/abstractRecord #6 of 271ID: CD006247AU: van Dalen Elvira CAU: Mank ArnoAU: Leclercq EdithAU: Mulder Renée LAU: Davies MichelleAU: Kersten Marie JoséAU: van de Wetering Marianne DTI: Low bacterial diet versus control diet to prevent infection in cancer patients treated with chemotherapy causing episodes of neutropeniaSO: Cochrane Database of Systematic ReviewsYR: 2016NO: 4PB: John Wiley & Sons, LtdKY: Anti-Bacterial Agents [therapeutic use];Antifungal Agents [therapeutic use];Antineoplastic Agents [adverse effects];Bacterial Infections [prevention & control];Fever [diet therapy];Mycoses [prevention & control];Neoplasms [drug therapy];Neutropenia [chemically induced] [diet therapy];Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic;Humans[checkword]DOI: 10.1002/14651858.CD006247.pub3AB: Background: Neutropenia is a potentially serious side effect of chemotherapy and a major risk factor for infection, which can be life-threatening. It has been hypothesised that a low bacterial diet (LBD) can prevent infection and (infection-related) mortality in cancer patients receiving chemotherapy that causes episodes of neutropenia, but much remains unclear. This review is an update of a previously published Cochrane review.Objectives: The primary objective of this review was to determine the efficacy of an LBD versus a control diet in preventing infection and in decreasing (infection-related) mortality in adult and paediatric cancer patients receiving chemotherapy that causes episodes of neutropenia. Secondary objectives were to assess time to first febrile episode, need for empirical antibiotic therapy, diet acceptability and quality of life.Search methods: We searched the following electronic databases: the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (2015, Issue 4), the Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects (DARE) (2015, Issue 4), PubMed (from 1946 to 4 May 2015), EMBASE (from 1980 to 4 May 2015) and the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL) (from 1981 to 4 May 2015).In addition, we searched the reference lists of relevant articles and conference proceedings of American Society of Hematology (ASH; from 2000 to 2015), European Bone Marrow Transplantation (EBMT; from 2000 to 2015), Oncology Nurses Society (ONS; from 2000 to 2015), International Society for Paediatric Oncology (SIOP; from 2000 to 2014), Multinational Association of Supportive Care in Cancer (MASCC; from 2000 to 2015), American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO; from 2000 to 2015), Interscience Conference of Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy (ICAAC; from 2000 to 2015), European Society for Clinical Nutrition and Metabolism (ESPEN; from 2000 to 2015), American Society for Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (ASPEN; from 2000 to 2015) and European Hematology Association (EHA; from 2000 to 2015). In May 2015, we scanned the National Institutes of Health Register via clinicaltrials.gov and the International Standard Randomised Controlled Trial Number (ISRCTN) Register (www.controlled-trials.com).Selection criteria: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing use of an LBD versus a control diet with regard to infection rate, (infection-related) mortality, time to first febrile episode, need for empirical antibiotic therapy, diet acceptability and quality of life in adult and paediatric cancer patients receiving chemotherapy causing episodes of neutropenia.Data collection and analysis: Two review authors independently performed study selection, 'Risk of bias' assessment and data extraction. We performed analyses according to the guidelines of the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions.Main results: In the original version of this review, we identified three RCTs that assessed different intervention and control diets in 192 participants (97 randomised to intervention diet; 95 to control diet) with different types of malignancies. For the update, we identified no eligible new studies. Co-interventions (e.g. protective environment, antimicrobial prophylaxis, central venous catheter care, oral care, hygiene practices, colony-stimulating factors) and outcome definitions also differed between studies. In all included studies, it was standard policy to give empirical antibiotics (and sometimes also antimycotics) to (some of) the participants diagnosed with an infection. Two studies included adults and one study included children. In all studies, only a scant description of treatment regimens was provided. All studies had methodological limitations. Pooling of results of included studies was not possible. In two individual studies, no statistically significant differences in infection rate were identified between intervention and control diets; another study showed no significant differences between treatment groups in the number of chemotherapy cycles with an infection. None of the studies mentioned infection-related mortality, but in one study, no significant difference in overall survival was observed between treatment groups. Time from onset of neutropenia to fever, duration of empirical antibiotics and antimycotics, diet acceptability (i.e. following the diet easily and following the diet throughout all chemotherapy cycles) and quality of life were all evaluated by only one study; for all outcomes, no statistically significant differences between treatment arms were identified.Authors' conclusions: At the moment, no evidence from individual RCTs in children and adults with different malignancies underscores use of an LBD for prevention of infection and related outcomes. All studies differed with regard to co-interventions, outcome definitions and intervention and control diets. As pooling of results was not possible, and as all studies had serious methodological limitations, we could reach no definitive conclusions. It should be noted that 'no evidence of effect', as identified in this review, is not the same as 'evidence of no effect'. On the basis of currently available evidence, we are not able to provide recommendations for clinical practice. Additional high-quality research is needed.US: http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD006247.pub3/abstractRecord #7 of 271ID: CD006400AU: Hagen Kåre BirgerAU: Byfuglien Marte GjeitungAU: Falzon LouiseAU: Olsen Sissel UrkeAU: Smedslund GeirTI: Dietary interventions for rheumatoid arthritisSO: Cochrane Database of Systematic ReviewsYR: 2009NO: 1PB: John Wiley & Sons, LtdKY: Arthralgia [diet therapy];Arthritis, Rheumatoid [diet therapy];Diet, Mediterranean;Diet, Vegetarian;Fasting;Food, Formulated;Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic;Humans[checkword]CC: MUSKELDOI: 10.1002/14651858.CD006400.pub2AB: Background: The question of what potential benefits and harms are associated with certain dietary regimes used in rheumatoid arthritis is an important one for many patients and health care providers.Objectives: To assess the effectiveness and safety of dietary interventions in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis.Search methods: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL)(The Cochrane Library, issue 1 2008), MEDLINE, EMBASE, AMED, CINAHL and reference lists of relevant articles (up to January 2008), and contacted authors of included articles.Selection criteria: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) or controlled clinical trials (CCTs) where the effectiveness of dietary manipulation was evaluated. Dietary supplement studies (including fish oil supplements) were not included.Data collection and analysis: Two authors independently selected trials for inclusion, assessed the internal validity of included trials and extracted data. Investigators were contacted to obtain missing information.Main results: Fourteen RCTs and one CCT, with a total of 837 patients, were included. Due to heterogeneity of interventions and outcomes, baseline imbalance and inadequate data reporting, no overall effects were calculated. A single trial with a moderate risk of bias found that fasting, followed by 13 months on a vegetarian diet, may reduce pain (mean difference (MD) on a 0 to 10 scale -1.89, 95% confidence interval (CI) -3.62 to -0.16), but not physical function or morning stiffness immediately after intervention. Another single trial with a moderate risk of bias found that a 12-week Cretan Mediterranean diet may reduce pain (MD on a 0 to 100 scale -14.00, 95% CI -23.6 to -4.37), but not physical function or morning stiffness immediately after intervention. Two trials compared a 4-week elemental diet with an ordinary diet and reported no significant differences in pain, function or stiffness. Due to inadequate data reporting, the effects of vegan and elimination diets are uncertain. When comparing any dietary manipulation with an ordinary diet we found a significantly higher total drop-out of 10% (risk difference (RD) 0.10, 95% CI 0.02 to 0.18), higher treatment-related drop-out of 5% (RD 0.05, 95% CI -0.03 to 0.14) and a significantly higher weight loss (weighted mean difference -3.23, 95% CI -4.79 to -1.67 kg) in the diet groups compared to the control groups.Authors' conclusions: The effects of dietary manipulation, including vegetarian, Mediterranean, elemental and elimination diets, on rheumatoid arthritis are still uncertain due to the included studies being small, single trials with moderate to high risk of bias. Higher drop-out rates and weight loss in the groups with dietary manipulation indicate that potential adverse effects should not be ignored.US: http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD006400.pub2/abstractRecord #8 of 271ID: CD005627AU: Amorim Adegboye Amanda RAU: Linne Yvonne MTI: Diet or exercise, or both, for weight reduction in women after childbirthSO: Cochrane Database of Systematic ReviewsYR: 2013NO: 7PB: John Wiley & Sons, LtdKY: Diet, Reducing;Exercise;Postpartum Period;Weight Loss;Combined Modality Therapy [methods];Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic;Female[checkword];Humans[checkword]CC: PREGDOI: 10.1002/14651858.CD005627.pub3AB: Background: Weight retention after pregnancy may contribute to obesity. It is known that diet and exercise are recommended components of any weight loss programme in the general population. However, strategies to achieve healthy body weight among postpartum women have not been adequately evaluated.Objectives: The objectives of this review were to evaluate the effect of diet, exercise or both for weight reduction in women after childbirth, and to assess the impact of these interventions on maternal body composition, cardiorespiratory fitness, breastfeeding performance and other child and maternal outcomes.Search methods: We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (31 January 2012) and LILACS (31 January 2012). We scanned secondary references and contacted experts in the field. We updated the search of the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register on 30 April 2013 and added the results to the awaiting classification section of the review.Selection criteria: All published and unpublished randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-randomised trials of diet or exercise or both, among women during the postpartum period.Data collection and analysis: Both review authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. Results are presented using risk ratio (RR) for categorical data and mean difference (MD) for continuous data. Data were analysed with a fixed-effect model. A random-effects model was used in the presence of heterogeneity.Main results: Fourteen trials were included, but only 12 trials involving 910 women contributed data to outcome analysis. Women who exercised did not lose significantly more weight than women in the usual care group (two trials; n = 53; MD -0.10 kg; 95% confidence interval (CI) -1.90 to 1.71). Women who took part in a diet (one trial; n = 45; MD -1.70 kg; 95% CI -2.08 to -1.32), or diet plus exercise programme (seven trials; n = 573; MD -1.93 kg; 95% CI -2.96 to -0.89; random-effects, T² = 1.09, I² = 71%), lost significantly more weight than women in the usual care group. There was no difference in the magnitude of weight loss between diet alone and diet plus exercise group (one trial; n = 43; MD 0.30 kg; 95% CI -0.06 to 0.66). The interventions seemed not to affect breastfeeding performance adversely.Authors' conclusions: Evidence from this review suggests that both diet and exercise together and diet alone help women to lose weight after childbirth. Nevertheless, it may be preferable to lose weight through a combination of diet and exercise as this improves maternal cardiorespiratory fitness and preserves fat-free mass, while diet alone reduces fat-free mass. This needs confirmation in large trials of high methodological quality. For women who are breastfeeding, more evidence is required to confirm whether diet or exercise, or both, is not detrimental for either mother or baby.US: http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD005627.pub3/abstractRecord #9 of 271ID: CD005105AU: Thomas DianaAU: Elliott Elizabeth JAU: Baur LouiseTI: Low glycaemic index or low glycaemic load diets for overweight and obesitySO: Cochrane Database of Systematic ReviewsYR: 2007NO: 3PB: John Wiley & Sons, LtdKY: Glycemic Index;Weight Loss;Cardiovascular Diseases [blood];Diet, Reducing;Dietary Carbohydrates [administration & dosage];Insulin Resistance;Obesity [blood] [diet therapy];Overweight;Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic;Female[checkword];Humans[checkword];Male[checkword]CC: ENDOCDOI: 10.1002/14651858.CD005105.pub2AB: Background: Obesity is increasingly prevalent, yet the nutritional management remains contentious. It has been suggested that low glycaemic index or load diets may stimulate greater weight loss than higher glycaemic index or load diets or other weight reduction diets.Objectives: To assess the effects of low glycaemic index or load diets for weight loss in overweight or obese people.Search methods: Trials were identified through The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL and manual searches of bibliographies.Selection criteria: Randomised controlled trials comparing a low glycaemic index or load diet (LGI) with a higher glycaemic index or load diet or other diet (Cdiet) in overweight or obese people.Data collection and analysis: Two authors independently selected trials, assessed quality and extracted data, including any information provided on adverse effects.Main results: We identified six eligible randomised controlled trials (total of 202 participants). Interventions ranged from five weeks to six months duration with up to six months follow-up after the intervention ceased. The decrease in body mass (WMD -1.1 kg, 95% confidence interval (CI) -2.0 to -0.2, P < 0.05) (n = 163), total fat mass (WMD -1.1 kg, 95% CI -1.9 to -0.4, P < 0.05) (n =147) and body mass index (WMD -1.3, 95% CI -2.0 to -0.5, P < 0.05) (n = 48) was significantly greater in participants receiving LGI compared to Cdiets. The decrease in total cholesterol was significantly greater with LGI compared to Cdiets (WMD -0.22 mmol/L, 95% CI -0.43 to -0.02, P < 0.05), as was the change in LDL-cholesterol (WMD -0.24 mmol/L, 95% CI -0.44 to -0.05, P < 0.05). No study reported adverse effects, mortality or quality of life data.Authors' conclusions: Overweight or obese people on LGI lost more weight and had more improvement in lipid profiles than those receiving Cdiets. Body mass, total fat mass, body mass index, total cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol all decreased significantly more in the LGI group. In studies comparing ad libitum LGI diets to conventional restricted energy low-fat diets, participants fared as well or better on th LGI diet, even though they could eat as much as desired. Lowering the glycaemic load of the diet appears to be an effective method of promoting weight loss and improving lipid profiles and can be simply incorporated into a person's lifestyle. Further research with longer term follow-up will determine whether improvement continues long-term and improves quality of life.US: http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD005105.pub2/abstractRecord #10 of 271ID: CD006296AU: Thomas DianaAU: Elliott Elizabeth JTI: Low glycaemic index, or low glycaemic load, diets for diabetes mellitusSO: Cochrane Database of Systematic ReviewsYR: 2009NO: 1PB: John Wiley & Sons, LtdKY: Glycemic Index;Diabetes Mellitus, Type 1 [blood] [diet therapy];Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2 [blood] [diet therapy];Diet, Diabetic;Hemoglobin A, Glycosylated [metabolism];Hypoglycemia [prevention & control];Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic;Humans[checkword]CC: ENDOCDOI: 10.1002/14651858.CD006296.pub2AB: Background: The aim of diabetes management is to normalise blood glucose levels, since improved blood glucose control is associated with reduction in development, and progression, of complications. Nutritional factors affect blood glucose levels, however there is currently no universal approach to the optimal dietary treatment for diabetes. There is controversy about how useful the glycaemic index (GI) is in diabetic meal planning. Improved glycaemic control through diet could minimise medications, lessen risk of diabetic complications, improve quality of life and increase life expectancy.Objectives: To assess the effects of low glycaemic index, or low glycaemic load, diets on glycaemic control in people with diabetes.Search methods: We performed electronic searches of The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, EMBASE and CINAHL with no language restriction.Selection criteria: We assessed randomised controlled trials of four weeks or longer that compared a low glycaemic index, or low glycaemic load, diet with a higher glycaemic index, or load, or other diet for people with either type 1 or 2 diabetes mellitus, whose diabetes was not already optimally controlled.Data collection and analysis: Two reviewers independently extracted data on study population, intervention and outcomes for each included study, using standardised data extraction forms.Main results: Eleven relevant randomised controlled trials involving 402 participants were identified. There was a significant decrease in the glycated haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) parallel group of trials, the weighted mean difference (WMD) was  -0.5% with a 95% confidence interval (CI) of - 0.9 to -0.1, P = 0.02; and in the cross-over group of trials the WMD was -0.5% with a 95% CI of -1.0 to -0.1, P = 0.03. Episodes of hypoglycaemia were significantly fewer with low compared to high GI diet in one trial (difference of -0.8 episodes per patient per month, P < 0.01), and proportion of participants reporting more than 15 hyperglycaemic episodes per month was lower for low-GI diet compared to measured carbohydrate exchange diet in another study (35% versus 66%, P = 0.006). No study reported on mortality, morbidity or costs.Authors' conclusions: A low-GI diet can improve glycaemic control in diabetes without compromising hypoglycaemic events.US: http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD006296.pub2/abstractRecord #11 of 271ID: CD012105AU: Colquitt Jill LAU: Loveman EmmaAU: O'Malley ClaireAU: Azevedo Liane BAU: Mead EmmaAU: Al-Khudairy LenaAU: Ells Louisa JAU: Metzendorf Maria-IntiAU: Rees KarenTI: Diet, physical activity, and behavioural interventions for the treatment of overweight or obesity in preschool children up to the age of 6 yearsSO: Cochrane Database of Systematic ReviewsYR: 2016NO: 3PB: John Wiley & Sons, LtdKY: Body Mass Index;Behavior Therapy;Body Weight;Diet;Health Status;Motor Activity;Obesity [psychology] [therapy];Overweight [psychology] [therapy];Parent-Child Relations;Quality of Life;Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic;Self Concept;Child[checkword];Child, Preschool[checkword];Humans[checkword]CC: ENDOCDOI: 10.1002/14651858.CD012105AB: Background: Child overweight and obesity has increased globally, and can be associated with short- and long-term health consequences.Objectives: To assess the effects of diet, physical activity, and behavioural interventions for the treatment of overweight or obesity in preschool children up to the age of 6 years.Search methods: We performed a systematic literature search in the databases Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, CINAHL, and LILACS, as well as in the trial registers ClinicalTrials.gov and ICTRP Search Portal. We also checked references of identified trials and systematic reviews. We applied no language restrictions. The date of the last search was March 2015 for all databases.Selection criteria: We selected randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of diet, physical activity, and behavioural interventions for treating overweight or obesity in preschool children aged 0 to 6 years.Data collection and analysis: Two review authors independently assessed risk of bias, evaluated the overall quality of the evidence using the GRADE instrument, and extracted data following the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions. We contacted trial authors for additional information.Main results: We included 7 RCTs with a total of 923 participants: 529 randomised to an intervention and 394 to a comparator. The number of participants per trial ranged from 18 to 475. Six trials were parallel RCTs, and one was a cluster RCT. Two trials were three-arm trials, each comparing two interventions with a control group. The interventions and comparators in the trials varied. We categorised the comparisons into two groups: multicomponent interventions and dietary interventions. The overall quality of the evidence was low or very low, and six trials had a high risk of bias on individual 'Risk of bias' criteria. The children in the included trials were followed up for between six months and three years.In trials comparing a multicomponent intervention with usual care, enhanced usual care, or information control, we found a greater reduction in body mass index (BMI) z score in the intervention groups at the end of the intervention (6 to 12 months): mean difference (MD) -0.3 units (95% confidence interval (CI) -0.4 to -0.2); P < 0.00001; 210 participants; 4 trials; low-quality evidence, at 12 to 18 months' follow-up: MD -0.4 units (95% CI -0.6 to -0.2); P = 0.0001; 202 participants; 4 trials; low-quality evidence, and at 2 years' follow-up: MD -0.3 units (95% CI -0.4 to -0.1); 96 participants; 1 trial; low-quality evidence.One trial stated that no adverse events were reported; the other trials did not report on adverse events. Three trials reported health-related quality of life and found improvements in some, but not all, aspects. Other outcomes, such as behaviour change and parent-child relationship, were inconsistently measured.One three-arm trial of very low-quality evidence comparing two types of diet with control found that both the dairy-rich diet (BMI z score change MD -0.1 units (95% CI -0.11 to -0.09); P < 0.0001; 59 participants) and energy-restricted diet (BMI z score change MD -0.1 units (95% CI -0.11 to -0.09); P < 0.0001; 57 participants) resulted in greater reduction in BMI than the comparator at the end of the intervention period, but only the dairy-rich diet maintained this at 36 months' follow-up (BMI z score change in MD -0.7 units (95% CI -0.71 to -0.69); P < 0.0001; 52 participants). The energy-restricted diet had a worse BMI outcome than control at this follow-up (BMI z score change MD 0.1 units (95% CI 0.09 to 0.11); P < 0.0001; 47 participants). There was no substantial difference in mean daily energy expenditure between groups. Health-related quality of life, adverse effects, participant views, and parenting were not measured.No trial reported on all-cause mortality, morbidity, or socioeconomic effects.All results should be interpreted cautiously due to their low quality and heterogeneous interventions and comparators.Authors' conclusions: Muticomponent interventions appear to be an effective treatment option for overweight or obese preschool children up to the age of 6 years. However, the current evidence is limited, and most trials had a high risk of bias. Most trials did not measure adverse events. We have identified four ongoing trials that we will include in future updates of this review.The role of dietary interventions is more equivocal, with one trial suggesting that dairy interventions may be effective in the longer term, but not energy-restricted diets. This trial also had a high risk of bias.US: http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD012105/abstractRecord #12 of 271ID: CD006022AU: Escribano JoaquinAU: Balaguer AlbertAU: Roqué i Figuls MartaAU: Feliu AlbertAU: Ferre NataliaTI: Dietary interventions for preventing complications in idiopathic hypercalciuriaSO: Cochrane Database of Systematic ReviewsYR: 2014NO: 2PB: John Wiley & Sons, LtdKY: Calcium, Dietary [administration & dosage];Diet, Protein-Restricted;Diet, Sodium-Restricted;Hypercalciuria [complications] [diet therapy];Hyperoxaluria [prevention & control];Nephrolithiasis [diet therapy] [prevention & control];Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic;Adult[checkword];Humans[checkword]DOI: 10.1002/14651858.CD006022.pub4AB: Background: Idiopathic hypercalciuria is an inherited metabolic abnormality that is characterised by excessive amounts of calcium excreted in the urine by people whose calcium serum levels are normal. Morbidity associated with idiopathic hypercalciuria is chiefly related to kidney stone disease and bone demineralisation leading to osteopenia and osteoporosis. Idiopathic hypercalciuria contributes to kidney stone disease at all life stages; people with the condition are prone to developing oxalate and calcium phosphate kidney stones. In some cases, crystallised calcium can be deposited in the renal interstitium, causing increased calcium levels in the kidneys. In children, idiopathic hypercalciuria can cause a range of comorbidities including recurrent macroscopic or microscopic haematuria, frequency dysuria syndrome, urinary tract infections and abdominal and lumbar pain. Various dietary interventions have been described that aim to decrease urinary calcium levels or urinary crystallisation.Objectives: Our objectives were to assess the efficacy, effectiveness and safety of dietary interventions for preventing complications in idiopathic hypercalciuria (urolithiasis and osteopenia) in adults and children, and to assess the benefits of dietary interventions in decreasing urological symptomatology in children with idiopathic hypercalciuria.Search methods: We searched the Cochrane Renal Group's Specialised Register (23 April 2013) through contact with the Trials' Search Co-ordinator using search terms relevant to this review. Studies contained in the Specialised Register are identified through search strategies specifically designed for CENTRAL, MEDLINE and EMBASE.Selection criteria: We included all randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs that investigated dietary interventions aimed at preventing complications of idiopathic hypercalciuria, compared with placebo, no intervention, or other dietary interventions regardless of route of administration, dose or amount.Data collection and analysis: Studies were assessed for inclusion and data extracted using a standardised data extraction form. We calculated risk ratios (RR) for dichotomous outcomes and mean differences (MD) for continuous outcomes, both with 95% confidence intervals (CI).Main results: We included five studies (379 adult participants) that investigated a range of interventions. Lack of similarity among interventions investigated meant that data could not be pooled. Overall, study methodology was not adequately reported in any of the included studies. There was a high risk of bias associated with blinding (although it seems unlikely that outcomes measures were unduly influenced by lack of intervention blinding), random sequence generation and allocation methodologies were unclear in most studies, but selective reporting bias was assessed as low.One study (120 participants) compared a low calcium diet with a normal calcium, low protein, low salt diet for five years. There was a significant decrease in numbers of new stone recurrences in those treated with the normal calcium, low protein, low salt diet (RR 0.77, 95% CI 0.61 to 0.98). This diet also led to a significant decrease in oxaluria (MD 78.00 µmol/d, 95% CI 26.48 to 129.52) and the calcium oxalate relative supersaturation index (MD 1.20 95% CI 0.21 to 2.19).One study (210 participants) compared a low salt, normal calcium diet with a broad diet for three months. The low salt, normal calcium diet decreased urinary calcium (MD -45.00 mg/d, 95% CI -74.83 to -15.17) and oxalate excretion (MD -4.00 mg/d, 95% CI -6.44 to -1.56).A small study (17 participants) compared the effect of dietary fibre as part of a low calcium, low oxalate diet over three weeks, and found that although calciuria levels decreased, oxaluria increased. Phyllanthus niruri plant substrate intake was investigated in a small subgroup with hypercalciuria (20 participants); there was no significant effect on calciuria levels occurred after three months of treatment.A small cross-over study (12 participants) evaluating the changes in urinary supersaturation indices among patients who consumed calcium-fortified orange juice or milk for one month found no benefits for participants.None of the studies reported any significant adverse effects associated with the interventions.Authors' conclusions: Long-term adherence (five years) to diets that feature normal levels of calcium, low protein and low salt may reduce numbers of stone recurrences, decrease oxaluria and calcium oxalate relative supersaturation indexes in people with idiopathic hypercalciuria who experience recurrent kidney stones. Adherence to a low salt, normal calcium level diet for some months can reduce calciuria and oxaluria. However, the other dietary interventions examined did not demonstrate evidence of significant beneficial effects.No studies were found investigating the effect of dietary recommendations on other clinical complications or asymptomatic idiopathic hypercalciuria.US: http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD006022.pub4/abstractRecord #13 of 271ID: CD001892AU: Fouque DenisAU: Laville MauriceTI: Low protein diets for chronic kidney disease in non diabetic adultsSO: Cochrane Database of Systematic ReviewsYR: 2009NO: 3PB: John Wiley & Sons, LtdKY: Diet, Protein-Restricted;Chronic Disease;Disease Progression;Kidney Diseases [diet therapy];Kidney Failure, Chronic [prevention & control];Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic;Adult[checkword];Humans[checkword]CC: RENALDOI: 10.1002/14651858.CD001892.pub3AB: Background: For more than fifty years, low protein diets have been proposed to patients with kidney failure. However, the effects of these diets in preventing severe kidney failure and the need for maintenance dialysis have not been resolved.Objectives: To determine the efficacy of low protein diets in delaying the need to start maintenance dialysis.Search methods: Cochrane Renal Group studies register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled studies, MEDLINE, and EMBASE. Congress abstracts (American Society of Nephrology since 1990, European Dialysis Transplant Association since 1985, International Society of Nephrology since 1987). Direct contacts with investigators.Selection criteria: Randomised studies comparing two different levels of protein intake in adult patients suffering from moderate to severe kidney failure, followed for at least one year.Data collection and analysis: Two authors independently selected studies and extracted data. Statistical analyses were performed using the random effects model and the results expressed as risk ratio (RR) for dichotomous outcomes with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Collection of the number of "renal deaths" defined as the need for starting dialysis, the death of a patient or a kidney transplant during the study.Main results: Ten studies were identified from over 40 studies. A total of 2000 patients were analysed, 1002 had received reduced protein intake and 998 a higher protein intake. There were 281 renal deaths recorded, 113 in the low protein diet and 168 in the higher protein diet group (RR 0.68, 95% CI 0.55 to 0.84, P = 0.0002). To avoid one renal death, 2 to 56 patients need to be treated with a low protein diet during one year.Authors' conclusions: Reducing protein intake in patients with chronic kidney disease reduces the occurrence of renal death by 32% as compared with higher or unrestricted protein intake. The optimal level of protein intake cannot be confirmed from these studies.US: http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD001892.pub3/abstractRecord #14 of 271ID: CD007957AU: Smart Neil AAU: Marshall Belinda JAU: Daley MaxineAU: Boulos ElieAU: Windus JanelleAU: Baker NadineAU: Kwok NigelTI: Low-fat diets for acquired hypercholesterolaemiaSO: Cochrane Database of Systematic ReviewsYR: 2011NO: 2PB: John Wiley & Sons, LtdKY: Diet, Fat-Restricted [adverse effects] [methods];Hypercholesterolemia [diet therapy];Adult[checkword];Humans[checkword]CC: ENDOCDOI: 10.1002/14651858.CD007957.pub2AB: Background: Hypercholesterolaemia, characterised by raised blood cholesterol levels, is not a disease itself but a metabolic derangement that often contributes to many diseases, notably cardiovascular disease. In most cases, elevated cholesterol levels are associated with high-fat diet, especially saturated fat, coupled with an inactive lifestyle. Less commonly, raised cholesterol may be related to an inherited disorder, familial hypercholesterolaemia. This systematic review is only concerned with acquired hypercholesterolaemia.Objectives: To assess the effects of low-fat diets for acquired hypercholesterolaemia and to investigate the incidence of adverse effects from low-fat dietary interventions. We planned to compare the relative effectiveness of low-fat diets with calorie-restricted diets for acquired hypercholesterolaemia. We also wanted to look into the relative effectiveness of low-fat diets and pharmacological interventions for acquired hypercholesterolaemia.Search methods: Studies were obtained from computerised searches of The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, EMBASE and databases of ongoing trials. Date of last search was February 2010.Selection criteria: Otherwise healthy adults (equal to or greater than 18 years) with acquired (not familial) hypercholesterolaemia. We defined hypercholesterolaemia as either total cholesterol greater than 5.2 mmol/L, LDL-cholesterol greater than 3.0 mmol/L, HDL-cholesterol less than 1.0 mmol/L or a combination thereof, although investigators' definitions were also accepted. We wanted to include any low-fat dietary intervention, like low-fat and low-saturated fat diets, intended to lower serum total and LDL-cholesterol or to raise HDL-cholesterol. A low-fat diet was considered as a fat calorie intake less than 20% of the total calories. The minimum duration of the intervention had to be six months. We excluded studies in unhealthy people.Data collection and analysis: Two authors were planned to independently assess risk of bias and extract data.Main results: No study met our inclusion criteria.Authors' conclusions: Well designed, adequately powered randomised controlled trials investigating patient-relevant outcomes of low-fat diets for otherwise healthy people with hypercholesterolaemia are required.US: http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD007957.pub2/abstractRecord #15 of 271ID: CD004022AU: Graudal Niels AlbertAU: Hubeck-Graudal ThorbjornAU: Jurgens GescheTI: Effects of low sodium diet versus high sodium diet on blood pressure, renin, aldosterone, catecholamines, cholesterol, and triglycerideSO: Cochrane Database of Systematic ReviewsYR: 2011NO: 11PB: John Wiley & Sons, LtdKY: Diet, Sodium-Restricted;African Continental Ancestry Group;Aldosterone [blood];Asian Continental Ancestry Group;Blood Pressure [drug effects] [radiation effects];Catecholamines [blood];Cholesterol [blood];European Continental Ancestry Group;Hypertension [diet therapy] [ethnology];Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic;Renin [blood];Sodium Chloride, Dietary [pharmacology];Triglycerides [blood];Humans[checkword]CC: HTNDOI: 10.1002/14651858.CD004022.pub3AB: Background: In spite of more than 100 years of investigations the question of reduced sodium intake as a health prophylaxis initiative is still unsolved.Objectives: To estimate the effects of low sodium versus high sodium intake on systolic and diastolic blood pressure (SBP and DBP), plasma or serum levels of renin, aldosterone, catecholamines, cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein (HDL), low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and triglycerides.Search methods: PUBMED, EMBASE and Cochrane Central and reference lists of relevant articles were searched from 1950 to July 2011.Selection criteria: Studies randomizing persons to low sodium and high sodium diets were included if they evaluated at least one of the above outcome parameters.Data collection and analysis: Two authors independently collected data, which were analysed with Review Manager 5.1.Main results: A total of 167 studies were included in this 2011 update.The effect of sodium reduction in normotensive Caucasians was SBP -1.27 mmHg (95% CI: -1.88, -0.66; p=0.0001), DBP -0.05 mmHg (95% CI: -0.51, 0.42; p=0.85). The effect of sodium reduction in normotensive Blacks was SBP -4.02 mmHg (95% CI:-7.37, -0.68; p=0.002), DBP -2.01 mmHg (95% CI:-4.37, 0.35; p=0.09). The effect of sodium reduction in normotensive Asians was SBP -1.27 mmHg (95% CI: -3.07, 0.54; p=0.17), DBP -1.68 mmHg (95% CI:-3.29, -0.06; p=0.04). The effect of sodium reduction in hypertensive Caucasians was SBP -5.48 mmHg (95% CI: -6.53, -4.43; p<0.00001), DBP -2.75 mmHg (95% CI: -3.34, -2.17; p<0.00001). The effect of sodium reduction in hypertensive Blacks was SBP -6.44 mmHg (95% CI:-8.85, -4.03; p=0.00001), DBP -2.40 mmHg (95% CI:-4.68, -0.12; p=0.04). The effect of sodium reduction in hypertensive Asians was SBP -10.21 mmHg (95% CI:-16.98, -3.44; p=0.003), DBP -2.60 mmHg (95% CI: -4.03, -1.16; p=0.0004).In plasma or serum there was a significant increase in renin (p<0.00001), aldosterone (p<0.00001), noradrenaline (p<0.00001), adrenaline (p<0.0002), cholesterol (p<0.001) and triglyceride (p<0.0008) with low sodium intake as compared with high sodium intake. In general the results were similar in studies with a duration of at least 2 weeks.Authors' conclusions: Sodium reduction resulted in a 1% decrease in blood pressure in normotensives, a 3.5% decrease in hypertensives, a significant increase in plasma renin, plasma aldosterone, plasma adrenaline and plasma noradrenaline, a 2.5% increase in cholesterol, and a 7% increase in triglyceride. In general, these effects were stable in studies lasting for 2 weeks or more.US: http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD004022.pub3/abstractRecord #16 of 271ID: CD004467AU: Kelly Sarah AMAU: Frost GaryAU: Whittaker VictoriaAU: Summerbell Carolyn DTI: Low glycaemic index diets for coronary heart diseaseSO: Cochrane Database of Systematic ReviewsYR: 2004NO: 4PB: John Wiley & Sons, LtdKY: Glycemic Index;Blood Glucose [metabolism];Cholesterol [blood];Coronary Disease [mortality] [prevention & control];Dietary Carbohydrates [administration & dosage] [metabolism];Fasting [metabolism];Humans[checkword]CC: VASCDOI: 10.1002/14651858.CD004467.pub2AB: Background: The glycaemic index (GI) is a physiological measure of the ability of a carbohydrate to affect blood glucose. Interest is growing in the low GI carbohydrate concept for the clinical management of people at risk of, or with established coronary heart disease. There is a need to review the current evidence from randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in this area.Objectives: To review evidence from RCTs assessing the relationship between the consumption of low GI diets and the effects on coronary heart disease (CHD) and related risk factors in people who have established CHD or risk factors.Search methods: We searched CENTRAL on The Cochrane Library (Issue 2, 2006), MEDLINE (1966 to July 2006), EMBASE (1980 to July 2006) and CINAHL (1982 to July 2006). We checked references and contacted experts in the field. No language restrictions were applied.Selection criteria: We selected RCTs that assessed the effects of low GI diets, over a minimum of 4 weeks, on CHD and risk factors for CHD. Participants included were adults with at least one major risk factor for CHD e.g. abnormal lipids, diabetes or being overweight or who had previously been diagnosed with CHD.Data collection and analysis: Two reviewers independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. Authors of the included studies were contacted for additional information where necessary.Main results: Twenty-one RCTs were included, with a total of 713 participants randomised. No studies were found that reported the effect of low GI diets on CHD mortality or CHD events and morbidity. All 21 included studies report the effect of low GI diets on risk factors for CHD. Meta-analysis detected limited and weak evidence of slightly lower total cholesterol with low glycaemic index diets. However, when only studies on diabetics were included in the analysis, no evidence of an effect on total cholesterol was found. There is little evidence from the combination of studies in meta-analysis that low glycaemic index diets have an effect on LDL cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, triglycerides, glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA1c), fasting glucose or fasting insulin levels. However, the majority of individual studies do report slightly lower levels of glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA1c) with low GI diets.Authors' conclusions: There is no evidence from RCTs to show an effect of low GI diets on coronary heart disease. Weak evidence for minor effects on some CHD risk factors was found. Many of the trials identified were short-term, of poor quality and did not have sufficient power to detect clinically important differences. The combined evidence from the studies suggests that any beneficial effect of low glycaemic index diets on CHD and its risk factors is small. There is a need for well designed, adequately powered, randomised controlled studies, of greater than 12 weeks duration to assess the true effects of low glycaemic index diets for CHD.US: http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD004467.pub2/abstractRecord #17 of 271ID: CD003498AU: Millward ClaireAU: Ferriter MichaelAU: Calver Sarah JAU: Connell-Jones Graham GTI: Gluten- and casein-free diets for autistic spectrum disorderSO: Cochrane Database of Systematic ReviewsYR: 2008NO: 2PB: John Wiley & Sons, LtdKY: Autistic Disorder [diet therapy] [etiology] [psychology];Caseins [administration & dosage] [adverse effects];Glutens [administration & dosage] [adverse effects];Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic;Child[checkword];Humans[checkword]CC: BEHAVDOI: 10.1002/14651858.CD003498.pub3AB: Background: It has been suggested that peptides from gluten and casein may have a role in the origins of autism and that the physiology and psychology of autism might be explained by excessive opioid activity linked to these peptides. Research has reported abnormal levels of peptides in the urine and cerebrospinal fluid of people with autism.Objectives: To determine the efficacy of gluten and/or casein free diets as an intervention to improve behaviour, cognitive and social functioning in individuals with autism.Search methods: The following electronic databases were searched: CENTRAL(The Cochrane Library Issue 2, 2007), MEDLINE (1966 to April 2007), PsycINFO (1971 to April 2007), EMBASE (1974 to April 2007), CINAHL (1982 to April 2007), ERIC (1965 to 2007), LILACS (1982 to April 2007), and the National Research register 2007 (Issue1). Review bibliographies were also examined to identify potential trials.Selection criteria: All randomised controlled trials (RCT) involving programmes which eliminated gluten, casein or both gluten and casein from the diets of individuals diagnosed with an autistic spectrum disorder.Data collection and analysis: Abstracts of studies identified in searches of electronic databases were assessed to determine inclusion by two independent authors The included trials did not share common outcome measures and therefore no meta-analysis was possible. Data are presented in narrative form.Main results: Two small RCTs were identified (n = 35). No meta-analysis was possible. There were only three significant treatment effects in favour of the diet intervention: overall autistic traits, mean difference (MD) = -5.60 (95% CI -9.02 to -2.18), z = 3.21, p=0.001 (Knivsberg 2002) ; social isolation, MD = -3.20 (95% CI -5.20 to 1.20), z = 3.14, p = 0.002) and overall ability to communicate and interact, MD = 1.70 (95% CI 0.50 to 2.90), z = 2.77, p = 0.006) (Knivsberg 2003). In addition three outcomes showed no significant difference between the treatment and control group and we were unable to calculate mean differences for ten outcomes because the data were skewed. No outcomes were reported for disbenefits including harms.Authors' conclusions: Research has shown of high rates of use of complementary and alternative therapies (CAM) for children with autism including gluten and/or casein exclusion diets. Current evidence for efficacy of these diets is poor. Large scale, good quality randomised controlled trials are needed.US: http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD003498.pub3/abstractRecord #18 of 271ID: CD008274AU: Semlitsch ThomasAU: Jeitler KlausAU: Berghold AndreaAU: Horvath KarlAU: Posch NicoleAU: Poggenburg StephanieAU: Siebenhofer AndreaTI: Long-term effects of weight-reducing diets in people with hypertensionSO: Cochrane Database of Systematic ReviewsYR: 2016NO: 3PB: John Wiley & Sons, LtdKY: Blood Pressure;Cardiovascular Diseases [prevention & control];Diet, Reducing [adverse effects];Hypertension [diet therapy] [mortality];Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic;Weight Loss;Aged[checkword];Humans[checkword];Middle Aged[checkword]CC: HTNDOI: 10.1002/14651858.CD008274.pub3AB: Background: All major guidelines for antihypertensive therapy recommend weight loss. Thus dietary interventions that aim to reduce body weight might be a useful intervention to reduce blood pressure and adverse cardiovascular events associated with hypertension.Objectives: Primary objectivesTo assess the long-term effects of weight-reducing diets in people with hypertension on all-cause mortality, cardiovascular morbidity, and adverse events (including total serious adverse events, withdrawal due to adverse events, and total non-serious adverse events). Secondary objectivesTo assess the long-term effects of weight-reducing diets in people with hypertension on change from baseline in systolic blood pressure, change from baseline in diastolic blood pressure, and body weight reduction.Search methods: We obtained studies from computerised searches of the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), the Cochrane Hypertension Specialised Register, Ovid MEDLINE, and Ovid EMBASE, and from searches in reference lists, systematic reviews, and the clinical trials registry ClinicalTrials.gov (status as of 2 February 2015).Selection criteria: We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of at least 24 weeks' duration that compared weight-reducing dietary interventions to no dietary intervention in adults with primary hypertension.Data collection and analysis: Two review authors independently assessed risk of bias and extracted data. We pooled studies using fixed-effect meta-analysis. In case of moderate or larger heterogeneity as measured by Higgins I2, we used a random-effects model.Main results: This review update did not reveal any new studies, so the number of included studies remained the same: 8 studies involving a total of 2100 participants with high blood pressure and a mean age of 45 to 66 years. Mean treatment duration was 6 to 36 months. We judged the risk of bias as unclear or high for all but two trials. No study included mortality as a predefined outcome. One RCT evaluated the effects of dietary weight loss on a combined endpoint consisting of the necessity of reinstating antihypertensive therapy and severe cardiovascular complications. In this RCT, weight-reducing diet lowered the endpoint compared to no diet: hazard ratio 0.70 (95% confidence interval (CI), 0.57 to 0.87). None of the studies evaluated adverse events as designated in our protocol. There was low-quality evidence for a blood pressure reduction in participants assigned to weight loss diets as compared to controls: systolic blood pressure: mean difference (MD) -4.5 mm Hg (95% CI -7.2 to -1.8 mm Hg) (3 of 8 studies included in analysis), and diastolic blood pressure: MD -3.2 mm Hg (95% CI -4.8 to -1.5 mm Hg) (3 of  8  studies included in analysis). There was moderate-quality evidence for weight reduction in dietary weight loss groups as compared to controls: MD -4.0 kg (95% CI -4.8 to -3.2) (5 of 8 studies included in analysis). Two studies used withdrawal of antihypertensive medication as their primary outcome. Even though we did not consider this a relevant outcome for our review, the results of these studies strengthen the finding of reduction of blood pressure by dietary weight loss interventions.Authors' conclusions: In this update, the conclusions remain the same, as we found no new trials. In people with primary hypertension, weight loss diets reduced body weight and blood pressure, however the magnitude of the effects are uncertain due to the small number of participants and studies included in the analyses. Whether weight loss reduces mortality and morbidity is unknown. No useful information on adverse effects was reported in the relevant trials.US: http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD008274.pub3/abstractRecord #19 of 271ID: CD008722AU: Desroches SophieAU: Lapointe AnnieAU: Ratté StéphaneAU: Gravel KarineAU: Légaré FranceAU: Turcotte StéphaneTI: Interventions to enhance adherence to dietary advice for preventing and managing chronic diseases in adultsSO: Cochrane Database of Systematic ReviewsYR: 2013NO: 2PB: John Wiley & Sons, LtdKY: Patient Compliance;Chronic Disease [prevention & control] [therapy];Counseling [methods];Diet Therapy [methods];Dietetics [methods];Health Education [methods];Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic;Adult[checkword];Humans[checkword]DOI: 10.1002/14651858.CD008722.pub2AB: Background: It has been recognized that poor adherence can be a serious risk to the health and wellbeing of patients, and greater adherence to dietary advice is a critical component in preventing and managing chronic diseases.Objectives: To assess the effects of interventions for enhancing adherence to dietary advice for preventing and managing chronic diseases in adults.Search methods: We searched the following electronic databases up to 29 September 2010: The Cochrane Library (issue 9 2010), PubMed, EMBASE (Embase.com), CINAHL (Ebsco) and PsycINFO (PsycNET) with no language restrictions. We also reviewed: a) recent years of relevant conferences, symposium and colloquium proceedings and abstracts; b) web-based registries of clinical trials; and c) the bibliographies of included studies.Selection criteria: We included randomized controlled trials that evaluated interventions enhancing adherence to dietary advice for preventing and managing chronic diseases in adults. Studies were eligible if the primary outcome was the client’s adherence to dietary advice. We defined 'client' as an adult participating in a chronic disease prevention or chronic disease management study involving dietary advice.Data collection and analysis: Two review authors independently assessed the eligibility of the studies. They also assessed the risk of bias and extracted data using a modified version of the Cochrane Consumers and Communication Review Group data extraction template. Any discrepancies in judgement were resolved by discussion and consensus, or with a third review author. Because the studies differed widely with respect to interventions, measures of diet adherence, dietary advice, nature of the chronic diseases and duration of interventions and follow-up, we conducted a qualitative analysis. We classified included studies according to the function of the intervention and present results in a narrative table using vote counting for each category of intervention.Main results: We included 38 studies involving 9445 participants. Among studies that measured diet adherence outcomes between an intervention group and a control/usual care group, 32 out of 123 diet adherence outcomes favoured the intervention group, 4 favoured the control group whereas 62 had no significant difference between groups (assessment was impossible for 25 diet adherence outcomes since data and/or statistical analyses needed for comparison between groups were not provided). Interventions shown to improve at least one diet adherence outcome are: telephone follow-up, video, contract, feedback, nutritional tools and more complex interventions including multiple interventions. However, these interventions also shown no difference in some diet adherence outcomes compared to a control/usual care group making inconclusive results about the most effective intervention to enhance dietary advice. The majority of studies reporting a diet adherence outcome favouring the intervention group compared to the control/usual care group in the short-term also reported no significant effect at later time points. Studies investigating interventions such as a group session, individual session, reminders, restriction and behaviour change techniques reported no diet adherence outcome showing a statistically significant difference favouring the intervention group. Finally, studies were generally of short duration and low quality, and adherence measures varied widely.Authors' conclusions: There is a need for further, long-term, good-quality studies using more standardized and validated measures of adherence to identify the interventions that should be used in practice to enhance adherence to dietary advice in the context of a variety of chronic diseases.US: http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD008722.pub2/abstractRecord #20 of 271ID: CD004097AU: Nield LucieAU: Moore HelenAU: Hooper LeeAU: Cruickshank KennedyAU: Vyas AvniAU: Whittaker VickiAU: Summerbell Carolyn DTI: Dietary advice for treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus in adultsSO: Cochrane Database of Systematic ReviewsYR: 2007NO: 3PB: John Wiley & Sons, LtdKY: Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2 [diet therapy];Diet, Fat-Restricted;Dietary Carbohydrates [administration & dosage];Dietary Fats [administration & dosage];Energy Intake;Exercise;Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic;Weight Loss;Adult[checkword];Humans[checkword]CC: ENDOCDOI: 10.1002/14651858.CD004097.pub4AB: Background: While initial dietary management immediately after formal diagnosis is an 'accepted' cornerstone of treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus, a formal and systematic overview of its efficacy and method of delivery is not currently available.Objectives: To assess the effects of type and frequency of different types of dietary advice for adults with type 2 diabetes.Search methods: We carried out a comprehensive search of The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, AMED, bibliographies and contacted relevant experts.Selection criteria: All randomised controlled trials, of six months or longer, in which dietary advice was the main intervention.Data collection and analysis: The lead investigator performed all data extraction and quality scoring with duplication being carried out by one of the other six investigators independently with discrepancies resolved by discussion and consensus. Authors were contacted for missing data.Main results: Thirty-six articles reporting a total of eighteen trials following 1467 participants were included. Dietary approaches assessed in this review were low-fat/high-carbohydrate diets, high-fat/low-carbohydrate diets, low-calorie (1000 kcal per day) and very-low-calorie (500 kcal per day) diets and modified fat diets. Two trials compared the American Diabetes Association exchange diet with a standard reduced fat diet and five studies assessed low-fat diets versus moderate fat or low-carbohydrate diets. Two studies assessed the effect of a very-low-calorie diet versus a low-calorie diet. Six studies compared dietary advice with dietary advice plus exercise and three other studies assessed dietary advice versus dietary advice plus behavioural approaches. The studies all measured weight and measures of glycaemic control although not all studies reported these in the articles published. Other outcomes which were measured in these studies included mortality, blood pressure, serum cholesterol (including LDL and HDL cholesterol), serum triglycerides, maximal exercise capacity and compliance. The results suggest that adoption of regular exercise is a good way to promote better glycaemic control in type 2 diabetic patients, however all of these studies were at high risk of bias.Authors' conclusions: There are no high quality data on the efficacy of the dietary treatment of type 2 diabetes, however the data available indicate that the adoption of exercise appears to improve glycated haemoglobin at six and twelve months in people with type 2 diabetes. There is an urgent need for well-designed studies which examine a range of interventions, at various points during follow-up, although there is a promising study currently underway.US: http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD004097.pub4/abstractRecord #21 of 271ID: CD001918AU: Malhotra AnitaAU: Shafiq NusratAU: Arora AnjumanAU: Singh MeenuAU: Kumar RajendraAU: Malhotra SamirTI: Dietary interventions (plant sterols, stanols, omega-3 fatty acids, soy protein and dietary fibers) for familial hypercholesterolaemiaSO: Cochrane Database of Systematic ReviewsYR: 2014NO: 6PB: John Wiley & Sons, LtdKY: Diet, Fat-Restricted;Cross-Over Studies;Fatty Acids, Omega-3 [administration & dosage];Hyperlipoproteinemia Type II [diet therapy];Phytosterols [administration & dosage];Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic;Soybean Proteins [administration & dosage];Adult[checkword];Child[checkword];Humans[checkword]CC: CFDOI: 10.1002/14651858.CD001918.pub3AB: Background: A cholesterol-lowering diet and several other dietary interventions have been suggested as a management approach either independently or as an adjuvant to drug therapy in children and adults with familial hypercholesterolaemia (FH). However, a consensus has yet to be reached on the most appropriate dietary treatment. Plant sterols are commonly used in FH although patients may know them by other names like phytosterols or stanols.Objectives: To examine whether a cholesterol-lowering diet is more effective in reducing ischaemic heart disease and lowering cholesterol than no dietary intervention in children and adults with familial hypercholesterolaemia. Further, to compare the efficacy of supplementing a cholesterol-lowering diet with either omega-3 fatty acids, soya proteins, plant sterols or plant stanols.Search methods: We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group Inborn Errors of Metabolism Trials Register, which is compiled from electronic searches of the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (updated with each new issue of The Cochrane Library), quarterly searches of MEDLINE and the prospective handsearching of one journal - Journal of Inherited Metabolic Disease. Most recent search of the Group's Inborn Errors of Metabolism Trials Register: 22 August 2013. We also searched PubMed to 05 February 2012.Selection criteria: Randomised controlled trials, both published and unpublished, where a cholesterol-lowering diet in children and adults with familial hypercholesterolaemia has been compared to other forms of dietary treatment or to no dietary intervention were included.Data collection and analysis: Two authors independently assessed the trial eligibility and risk of bias and one extracted the data, with independent verification of data extraction by a colleague.Main results: In the 2014 update of the review, 15 trials have been included, with a total of 453 participants across seven comparison groups. The included trials had either a low or unclear risk of bias for most of the parameters used for risk assessment. Only short-term outcomes could be assessed due to the short duration of follow up in the included trials. None of the primary outcomes, (incidence of ischaemic heart disease, number of deaths and age at death) were evaluated in any of the included trials. No significant differences were noted for the majority of secondary outcomes for any of the planned comparisons. However, a significant difference was found for the following comparisons and outcomes: for the comparison between plant sterols and cholesterol-lowering diet (in favour of plant sterols), total cholesterol levels, mean difference 0.30 mmol/l (95% confidence interval 0.12 to 0.48); decreased serum LDL cholesterol, mean difference -0.60 mmol/l (95% CI -0.89 to -0.31). Fasting serum HDL cholesterol levels were elevated, mean difference -0.04 mmol/l (95% CI -0.11 to 0.03) and serum triglyceride concentration was reduced, mean difference -0.03 mmol/l (95% CI -0.15 to -0.09), although these changes were not statistically significant. Similarly, guar gum when given as an add on therapy to bezafibrate reduced total cholesterol and LDL levels as compared to bezafibrate alone.Authors' conclusions: No conclusions can be made about the effectiveness of a cholesterol-lowering diet, or any of the other dietary interventions suggested for familial hypercholesterolaemia, for the primary outcomes: evidence and incidence of ischaemic heart disease, number of deaths and age at death,due to the lack of data on these. Large, parallel, randomised controlled trials are needed to investigate the effectiveness of a cholesterol-lowering diet and the addition of omega-3 fatty acids, plant sterols or stanols, soya protein, dietary fibers to a cholesterol-lowering diet.US: http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD001918.pub3/abstractRecord #22 of 271ID: CD002128AU: Rees KarenAU: Dyakova MarianaAU: Wilson NicolaAU: Ward KirstenAU: Thorogood MargaretAU: Brunner EricTI: Dietary advice for reducing cardiovascular riskSO: Cochrane Database of Systematic ReviewsYR: 2013NO: 12PB: John Wiley & Sons, LtdKY: Diet;Blood Pressure [physiology];Cardiovascular Diseases [prevention & control];Cholesterol [blood];Diet, Fat-Restricted;Diet, Sodium-Restricted;Dietetics [methods];Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic;Adult[checkword];Humans[checkword]DOI: 10.1002/14651858.CD002128.pub5AB: Background: Changes in population diet are likely to reduce cardiovascular disease and cancer, but the effect of dietary advice is uncertain. This review is an update of a previous review published in 2007.Objectives: To assess the effects of providing dietary advice to achieve sustained dietary changes or improved cardiovascular risk profile among healthy adults.Search methods: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, the Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects (DARE) and the HTA database on The Cochrane Library (Issue 4, 2010). We searched MEDLINE (Ovid) (1950 to week 2 October 2010) and EMBASE (Ovid) (1980 to Week 42 2010). Additional searches were done on CAB Health (1972 to December 1999), CVRCT registry (2000), CCT (2000) and SIGLE (1980 to 2000). Dissertation abstracts and reference lists of articles were checked and researchers were contacted.Selection criteria: Randomised studies with no more than 20% loss to follow-up, lasting at least three months and involving healthy adults comparing dietary advice with no advice or minimal advice. Trials involving children, trials to reduce weight or those involving supplementation were excluded.Data collection and analysis: Two review authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. Study authors were contacted for additional information.Main results: Forty-four trials with 52 intervention arms (comparisons) comparing dietary advice with no advice were included in the review; 18,175 participants or clusters were randomised. Twenty-nine of the 44 included trials were conducted in the USA. Dietary advice reduced total serum cholesterol by 0.15 mmol/L (95% CI 0.06 to 0.23) and LDL cholesterol by 0.16 mmol/L (95% CI 0.08 to 0.24) after 3 to 24 months. Mean HDL cholesterol levels and triglyceride levels were unchanged. Dietary advice reduced blood pressure by 2.61 mm Hg systolic (95% CI 1.31 to 3.91) and 1.45 mm Hg diastolic (95% CI 0.68 to 2.22) and 24-hour urinary sodium excretion by 40.9 mmol (95% CI 25.3 to 56.5) after 3 to 36 months but there was heterogeneity between trials for the latter outcome. Three trials reported plasma antioxidants, where small increases were seen in lutein and β-cryptoxanthin, but there was heterogeneity in the trial effects. Self-reported dietary intake may be subject to reporting bias, and there was significant heterogeneity in all the following analyses. Compared to no advice, dietary advice increased fruit and vegetable intake by 1.18 servings/day (95% CI 0.65 to 1.71). Dietary fibre intake increased with advice by 6.5 g/day (95% CI 2.2 to 10.82), while total dietary fat as a percentage of total energy intake fell by 4.48% (95% CI 2.47 to 6.48) with dietary advice, and saturated fat intake fell by 2.39% (95% CI 1.4 to 3.37).Two trials analysed incident cardiovascular disease (CVD) events (TOHP I/II). Follow-up was 77% complete at 10 to 15 years after the end of the intervention period and estimates of event rates lacked precision but suggested that sodium restriction advice probably led to a reduction in cardiovascular events (combined fatal plus non-fatal events) plus revascularisation (TOHP I hazards ratio (HR) 0.59, 95% CI 0.33 to 1.08; TOHP II HR 0.81, 95% CI 0.59 to 1.12).Authors' conclusions: Dietary advice appears to be effective in bringing about modest beneficial changes in diet and cardiovascular risk factors over approximately 12 months, but longer-term effects are not known.US: http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD002128.pub5/abstractRecord #23 of 271ID: CD005203AU: Bath-Hextall Fiona JAU: Delamere Finola MAU: Williams Hywel CTI: Dietary exclusions for established atopic eczemaSO: Cochrane Database of Systematic ReviewsYR: 2008NO: 1PB: John Wiley & Sons, LtdKY: Dermatitis, Atopic [diet therapy];Egg Hypersensitivity [diet therapy];Food, Formulated;Milk Hypersensitivity [diet therapy];Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic;Humans[checkword]CC: SKINDOI: 10.1002/14651858.CD005203.pub2AB: Background: Atopic eczema (AE) is a non-infective chronic inflammatory skin disease characterised by an itchy red rash.Objectives: To assess the effects of dietary exclusions for the treatment of established atopic eczema.Search methods: We searched The Cochrane Skin Group Specialised Register (to March 2006), The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) in The Cochrane Library (Issue 1, 2006), MEDLINE (2003 to March 2006), EMBASE (2003 to March 2006), LILACS (to March 2006), PsycINFO (1806 to March 2006), AMED (1985 to March 2006), ISI Web of Science (March 2006), www.controlled-trials.com, www.clinicaltrials.gov and www.nottingham.ac.uk/ongoingskintrials (March 2006). Pharmaceutical companies were contacted where appropriate for reviews or unpublished trials.Selection criteria: People who have atopic eczema as diagnosed by a doctor.Data collection and analysis: Two independent authors carried out study selection and assessment of methodological quality.Main results: We found 9 RCTs involving a total of 421 participants of which 6 were studies of egg and milk exclusion (N=288), 1 was a study of few foods (N=85) and 2 were studies of an elemental diet (N=48).There appears to be no benefit of an egg and milk free diet in unselected participants with atopic eczema. There is also no evidence of benefit in the use of an elemental or few-foods diet in unselected cases of atopic eczema. There may be some benefit in using an egg-free diet in infants with suspected egg allergy who have positive specific IgE to eggs - one study found 51% of the children had a significant improvement in body surface area with the exclusion diet compared to normal diet (RR 1.51, 95% CI 1.07 to 2.11) and change in surface area and severity score was significantly improved in the exclusion diet compared to the normal diet at the end of 6 weeks (MD 5.50, 95% CI 0.19 to 10.81) and end of treatment (MD 6.10, 95% CI 0.06 to12.14).Methodological difficulties have made it difficult to interpret these studies. Poor concealment of randomisation allocation, lack of blinding and high dropout rates without an intention-to-treat analysis indicates that these studies should be interpreted with great caution.Authors' conclusions: There may be some benefit in using an egg-free diet in infants with suspected egg allergy who have positive specific IgE to eggs. Little evidence supports the use of various exclusion diets in unselected people with atopic eczema, but that may be because they were not allergic to those substances in the first place. Lack of any benefit may also be because the studies were too small and poorly reported. Future studies should be appropriately powered focusing on participants with a proven food allergy. In addition a distinction should be made between young children whose food allergies improve with time and older children/adults.US: http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD005203.pub2/abstractRecord #24 of 271ID: CD001304AU: Poustie Vanessa JAU: Wildgoose JoanneTI: Dietary interventions for phenylketonuriaSO: Cochrane Database of Systematic ReviewsYR: 2010NO: 1PB: John Wiley & Sons, LtdKY: Phenylalanine [administration & dosage] [blood];Phenylketonurias [blood] [diet therapy];Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic;Treatment Outcome;Humans[checkword]CC: CFDOI: 10.1002/14651858.CD001304.pub2AB: Background: Phenylketonuria is an inherited disease treated with dietary restriction of the amino acid phenylalanine. The diet is initiated in the neonatal period to prevent mental handicap; however, it is restrictive and can be difficult to follow. Whether the diet can be relaxed or discontinued during adolescence or should be continued for life remains a controversial issue, which we aim to address in this review.Objectives: To assess the effects of a low-phenylalanine diet commenced early in life for people with phenylketonuria. To assess the possible effects of relaxation or termination of the diet on intelligence, neuropsychological outcomes and mortality, growth, nutritional status, eating behaviour and quality of life.Search methods: We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group Trials Register comprising references identified from comprehensive electronic database searches, handsearches of relevant journals and abstract books of conference proceedings.Most recent search of the Inborn Errors of Metabolism Trials Register: 05 March 2009.Selection criteria: All randomised or quasi-randomised controlled trials comparing a low-phenylalanine diet to relaxation or termination of dietary restrictions in people with phenylketonuria.Data collection and analysis: Two authors independently assessed study eligibility and methodological quality, and subsequently extracted the data.Main results: We included four studies in this review (251 participants), and found few significant differences between treatment and comparison groups for the outcomes of interest. Blood phenylalanine levels were significantly lower in participants with phenylketonuria following a low-phenylalanine diet compared to those on a less restricted diet, mean difference (MD) at three months -698.67 (95% confidence interval (CI) -869.44 to -527.89). Intelligence quotient was significantly higher in participants who continued the diet than in those who stopped the diet, MD after 12 months 5.00 (95% CI 0.40 to 9.60). However, these results came from a single study.Authors' conclusions: The results of non-randomised studies have concluded that a low-phenylalanine diet is effective in reducing blood phenylalanine levels and improving intelligence quotient and neuropsychological outcomes. We were unable to find any randomised controlled studies that have assessed the effect of a low-phenylalanine diet versus no diet from diagnosis. In view of evidence from non-randomised studies, such a study would be unethical and it is recommended that low-phenylalanine diet should be commenced at the time of diagnosis. There is uncertainty about the precise level of phenylalanine restriction and when, if ever, the diet should be relaxed. This should be addressed by randomised controlled studies.US: http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD001304.pub2/abstractRecord #25 of 271ID: CD006674AU: Tieu JoannaAU: Shepherd EmilyAU: Middleton PhilippaAU: Crowther Caroline ATI: Dietary advice interventions in pregnancy for preventing gestational diabetes mellitusSO: Cochrane Database of Systematic ReviewsYR: 2017NO: 1PB: John Wiley & Sons, LtdKY: Diet;Glycemic Index;Birth Weight;Diabetes, Gestational [prevention & control];Dietary Fiber [administration & dosage];Female[checkword];Humans[checkword];Infant, Newborn[checkword];Pregnancy[checkword]DOI: 10.1002/14651858.CD006674.pub3AB: Background: Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is a form of diabetes occurring during pregnancy which can result in short- and long-term adverse outcomes for women and babies. With an increasing prevalence worldwide, there is a need to assess strategies, including dietary advice interventions, that might prevent GDM.Objectives: To assess the effects of dietary advice interventions for preventing GDM and associated adverse health outcomes for women and their babies.Search methods: We searched Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth's Trials Register (3 January 2016) and reference lists of retrieved studies.Selection criteria: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs assessing the effects of dietary advice interventions compared with no intervention (standard care), or to different dietary advice interventions. Cluster-RCTs were eligible for inclusion but none were identified.Data collection and analysis: Two review authors independently assessed study eligibility, extracted data and assessed the risk of bias of the included studies. Data were checked for accuracy. The quality of the evidence was assessed using the GRADE approach.Main results: We included 11 trials involving 2786 women and their babies, with an overall unclear to moderate risk of bias. Six trials compared dietary advice interventions with standard care; four compared low glycaemic index (GI) with moderate- to high-GI dietary advice; one compared specific (high-fibre focused) with standard dietary advice. Dietary advice interventions versus standard care (six trials)Considering primary outcomes, a trend towards a reduction in GDM was observed for women receiving dietary advice compared with standard care (average risk ratio (RR) 0.60, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.35 to 1.04; five trials, 1279 women; Tau² = 0.20; I² = 56%; P = 0.07; GRADE: very low-quality evidence); subgroup analysis suggested a greater treatment effect for overweight and obese women receiving dietary advice. While no clear difference was observed for pre-eclampsia (RR 0.61, 95% CI 0.25 to 1.46; two trials, 282 women; GRADE: low-quality evidence) a reduction in pregnancy-induced hypertension was observed for women receiving dietary advice (RR 0.30, 95% CI 0.10 to 0.88; two trials, 282 women; GRADE: low-quality evidence). One trial reported on perinatal mortality, and no deaths were observed (GRADE: very low-quality evidence). None of the trials reported on large-for-gestational age or neonatal mortality and morbidity.For secondary outcomes, no clear differences were seen for caesarean section (average RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.24; four trials, 1194 women; Tau² = 0.02; I² = 36%; GRADE: low-quality evidence) or perineal trauma (RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.23 to 3.08; one trial, 759 women; GRADE: very low-quality evidence). Women who received dietary advice gained less weight during pregnancy (mean difference (MD) -4.70 kg, 95% CI -8.07 to -1.34; five trials, 1336 women; Tau² = 13.64; I² = 96%; GRADE: low-quality evidence); the result should be interpreted with some caution due to considerable heterogeneity. No clear differences were seen for the majority of secondary outcomes reported, including childhood/adulthood adiposity (skin-fold thickness at six months) (MD -0.10 mm, 95% CI -0.71 to 0.51; one trial, 132 children; GRADE: low-quality evidence). Women receiving dietary advice had a lower well-being score between 14 and 28 weeks, more weight loss at three months, and were less likely to have glucose intolerance (one trial).The trials did not report on other secondary outcomes, particularly those related to long-term health and health service use and costs. We were not able to assess the following outcomes using GRADE: postnatal depression; maternal type 2 diabetes; neonatal hypoglycaemia; childhood/adulthood type 2 diabetes; and neurosensory disability. Low-GI dietary advice versus moderate- to high-GI dietary advice (four trials)Considering primary outcomes, no clear differences were shown in the risks of GDM (RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.63 to 1.31; four trials, 912 women; GRADE: low-quality evidence) or large-for-gestational age (average RR 0.60, 95% CI 0.19 to 1.86; three trials, 777 babies; Tau² = 0.61; P = 0.07; I² = 62%; GRADE: very low-quality evidence) between the low-GI and moderate- to high-GI dietary advice groups. The trials did not report on: hypertensive disorders of pregnancy; perinatal mortality; neonatal mortality and morbidity.No clear differences were shown for caesarean birth (RR 1.27, 95% CI 0.79 to 2.04; two trials, 201 women; GRADE: very low-quality evidence) and gestational weight gain (MD -1.23 kg, 95% CI -4.08 to 1.61; four trials, 787 women; Tau² = 7.31; I² = 90%; GRADE: very low-quality evidence), or for other reported secondary outcomes.The trials did not report the majority of secondary outcomes including those related to long-term health and health service use and costs. We were not able to assess the following outcomes using GRADE: perineal trauma; postnatal depression; maternal type 2 diabetes; neonatal hypoglycaemia; childhood/adulthood adiposity; type 2 diabetes; and neurosensory disability. High-fibre dietary advice versus standard dietary advice (one trial)The one trial in this comparison reported on two secondary outcomes. No clear difference between the high-fibre and standard dietary advice groups observed for mean blood glucose (following an oral glucose tolerance test at 35 weeks), and birthweight.Authors' conclusions: Very low-quality evidence from five trials suggests a possible reduction in GDM risk for women receiving dietary advice versus standard care, and low-quality evidence from four trials suggests no clear difference for women receiving low- versus moderate- to high-GI dietary advice. A possible reduction in pregnancy-induced hypertension for women receiving dietary advice was observed and no clear differences were seen for other reported primary outcomes. There were few outcome data for secondary outcomes.For outcomes assessed using GRADE, evidence was considered to be low to very low quality, with downgrading based on study limitations (risk of bias), imprecision, and inconsistency.More high-quality evidence is needed to determine the effects of dietary advice interventions in pregnancy. Future trials should be designed to monitor adherence, women's views and preferences, and powered to evaluate effects on short- and long-term outcomes; there is a need for such trials to collect and report on core outcomes for GDM research. We have identified five ongoing studies and four are awaiting classification. We will consider these in the next review update.US: http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD006674.pub3/abstractRecord #26 of 271ID: CD000133AU: Kramer Michael SAU: Kakuma RitsukoTI: Maternal dietary antigen avoidance during pregnancy or lactation, or both, for preventing or treating atopic disease in the childSO: Cochrane Database of Systematic ReviewsYR: 2012NO: 9PB: John Wiley & Sons, LtdKY: Diet, Protein-Restricted;Lactation;Allergens [adverse effects];Dermatitis, Atopic [prevention & control];Dietary Proteins [adverse effects];Food Hypersensitivity;Hypersensitivity, Immediate [prevention & control];Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic;Risk Factors;Female[checkword];Humans[checkword];Infant[checkword];Infant, Newborn[checkword];Pregnancy[checkword]DOI: 10.1002/14651858.CD000133.pub3AB: Background: Some breastfed infants with atopic eczema benefit from elimination of cow milk, egg, or other antigens from their mother's diet. Maternal dietary antigens are also known to cross the placenta.Objectives: To assess the effects of prescribing an antigen avoidance diet during pregnancy or lactation, or both, on maternal and infant nutrition and on the prevention or treatment of atopic disease in the child.Search methods: We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (6 July 2012).Selection criteria: All randomized or quasi-randomized comparisons of maternal dietary antigen avoidance prescribed to pregnant or lactating women. We excluded trials of multimodal interventions that included manipulation of the infant's diet other than breast milk or of non-dietary aspects of the infant's environment.Data collection and analysis: We extracted data from published reports, supplemented by additional information received from the trialists we contacted.Main results: The evidence from five trials, involving 952 participants, does not suggest a protective effect of maternal dietary antigen avoidance during pregnancy on the incidence of atopic eczema during the first 18 months of life. Data on allergic rhinitis or conjunctivitis, or both, and urticaria are limited to a single trial each and are insufficient to draw meaningful inferences. Longer-term atopic outcomes have not been reported. The restricted diet during pregnancy was associated with a slightly but statistically significantly lower mean gestational weight gain, a non-significantly higher risk of preterm birth, and a non-significant reduction in mean birthweight.The evidence from two trials, involving 523 participants, did not observe a significant protective effect of maternal antigen avoidance during lactation on the incidence of atopic eczema during the first 18 months or on positive skin-prick tests to cow milk, egg, or peanut antigen at one, two, or seven years.One crossover trial involving 17 lactating mothers of infants with established atopic eczema found that maternal dietary antigen avoidance was associated with a non-significant reduction in eczema severity.Authors' conclusions: Prescription of an antigen avoidance diet to a high-risk woman during pregnancy is unlikely to reduce substantially her child's risk of atopic diseases, and such a diet may adversely affect maternal or fetal nutrition, or both. Prescription of an antigen avoidance diet to a high-risk woman during lactation may reduce her child's risk of developing atopic eczema, but better trials are needed.Dietary antigen avoidance by lactating mothers of infants with atopic eczema may reduce the severity of the eczema, but larger trials are needed.US: http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD000133.pub3/abstractRecord #27 of 271ID: CD010972AU: Newlove-Delgado Tamsin VAU: Martin Alice EAU: Abbott Rebecca AAU: Bethel AlisonAU: Thompson-Coon JoannaAU: Whear RebeccaAU: Logan StuartTI: Dietary interventions for recurrent abdominal pain in childhoodSO: Cochrane Database of Systematic ReviewsYR: 2017NO: 3PB: John Wiley & Sons, LtdDOI: 10.1002/14651858.CD010972.pub2AB: Background: This is an update of the original Cochrane review, last published in 2009 (Huertas-Ceballos 2009). Recurrent abdominal pain (RAP), including children with irritable bowel syndrome, is a common problem affecting between 4% and 25% of school-aged children. For the majority of such children, no organic cause for their pain can be found on physical examination or investigation. Many dietary inventions have been suggested to improve the symptoms of RAP. These may involve either excluding ingredients from the diet or adding supplements such as fibre or probiotics.Objectives: To examine the effectiveness of dietary interventions in improving pain in children of school age with RAP.Search methods: We searched CENTRAL, Ovid MEDLINE, Embase, eight other databases, and two trials registers, together with reference checking, citation searching and contact with study authors, in June 2016.Selection criteria: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing dietary interventions with placebo or no treatment in children aged five to 18 years with RAP or an abdominal pain-related, functional gastrointestinal disorder, as defined by the Rome III criteria (Rasquin 2006).Data collection and analysis: We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. We grouped dietary interventions together by category for analysis. We contacted study authors to ask for missing information and clarification, when needed. We assessed the quality of the evidence for each outcome using the GRADE approach.Main results: We included 19 RCTs, reported in 27 papers with a total of 1453 participants. Fifteen of these studies were not included in the previous review. All 19 RCTs had follow-up ranging from one to five months. Participants were aged between four and 18 years from eight different countries and were recruited largely from paediatric gastroenterology clinics. The mean age at recruitment ranged from 6.3 years to 13.1 years. Girls outnumbered boys in most trials. Fourteen trials recruited children with a diagnosis under the broad umbrella of RAP or functional gastrointestinal disorders; five trials specifically recruited only children with irritable bowel syndrome. The studies fell into four categories: trials of probiotic-based interventions (13 studies), trials of fibre-based interventions (four studies), trials of low FODMAP (fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides and polyols) diets (one study), and trials of fructose-restricted diets (one study).We found that children treated with probiotics reported a greater reduction in pain frequency at zero to three months postintervention than those given placebo (standardised mean difference (SMD) -0.55, 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.98 to -0.12; 6 trials; 523 children). There was also a decrease in pain intensity in the intervention group at the same time point (SMD -0.50, 95% CI -0.85 to -0.15; 7 studies; 575 children). However, we judged the evidence for these outcomes to be of low quality using GRADE due to an unclear risk of bias from incomplete outcome data and significant heterogeneity.We found that children treated with probiotics were more likely to experience improvement in pain at zero to three months postintervention than those given placebo (odds ratio (OR) 1.63, 95% CI 1.07 to 2.47; 7 studies; 722 children). The estimated number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) was eight, meaning that eight children would need to receive probiotics for one to experience improvement in pain in this timescale. We judged the evidence for this outcome to be of moderate quality due to significant heterogeneity.Children with a symptom profile defined as irritable bowel syndrome treated with probiotics were more likely to experience improvement in pain at zero to three months postintervention than those given placebo (OR 3.01, 95% CI 1.77 to 5.13; 4 studies; 344 children). Children treated with probiotics were more likely to experience improvement in pain at three to six months postintervention compared to those receiving placebo (OR 1.94, 95% CI 1.10 to 3.43; 2 studies; 224 children). We judged the evidence for these two outcomes to be of moderate quality due to small numbers of participants included in the studies.We found that children treated with fibre-based interventions were not more likely to experience an improvement in pain at zero to three months postintervention than children given placebo (OR 1.83, 95% CI 0.92 to 3.65; 2 studies; 136 children). There was also no reduction in pain intensity compared to placebo at the same time point (SMD -1.24, 95% CI -3.41 to 0.94; 2 studies; 135 children). We judged the evidence for these outcomes to be of low quality due to an unclear risk of bias, imprecision, and significant heterogeneity.We found only one study of low FODMAP diets and only one trial of fructose-restricted diets, meaning no pooled analyses were possible.We were unable to perform any meta-analyses for the secondary outcomes of school performance, social or psychological functioning, or quality of daily life, as not enough studies included these outcomes or used comparable measures to assess them.With the exception of one study, all studies reported monitoring children for adverse events; no major adverse events were reported.Authors' conclusions: Overall, we found moderate- to low-quality evidence suggesting that probiotics may be effective in improving pain in children with RAP. Clinicians may therefore consider probiotic interventions as part of a holistic management strategy. However, further trials are needed to examine longer-term outcomes and to improve confidence in estimating the size of the effect, as well as to determine the optimal strain and dosage. Future research should also explore the effectiveness of probiotics in children with different symptom profiles, such as those with irritable bowel syndrome.We found only a small number of trials of fibre-based interventions, with overall low-quality evidence for the outcomes. There was therefore no convincing evidence that fibre-based interventions improve pain in children with RAP. Further high-quality RCTs of fibre supplements involving larger numbers of participants are required. Future trials of low FODMAP diets and other dietary interventions are also required to facilitate evidence-based recommendations.US: http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD010972.pub2/abstractRecord #28 of 271ID: CD006863AU: Chaturvedi SwastiAU: Jones ColinTI: Protein restriction for children with chronic kidney diseaseSO: Cochrane Database of Systematic ReviewsYR: 2007NO: 4PB: John Wiley & Sons, LtdKY: Diet, Protein-Restricted;Disease Progression;Growth;Kidney Failure, Chronic [diet therapy];Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic;Renal Dialysis;Adolescent[checkword];Child[checkword];Child, Preschool[checkword];Humans[checkword]CC: RENALDOI: 10.1002/14651858.CD006863AB: Background: Protein restriction has been prescribed for some time for patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). The effect of a low protein diet on delaying the progression to end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) in children and its impact on growth and nutrition remains unresolved.Objectives: To determine the efficacy of protein restricted diet in delaying the start of maintenance dialysis and maintaining nutrition in children.Search methods: Cochrane Renal group trials register, the Cochrane Central register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, reference lists of nephrology textbooks, review articles and relevant studies.Selection criteria: Randomised control trials (RCTs) comparing un-restricted protein diet versus a protein restricted diet (to safe amounts recommended by WHO), with follow-up period of at least six months were included.Data collection and analysis: Two authors independently selected studies. Statistical analysis were performed using the random effects model. For dichotomous outcome results are expressed as risk ratio (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Where continuous scales of measurement are used to assess the effects of treatment, the mean difference (MD) was used.Main results: Two studies (250 children) were identified, 124 received a protein restricted diet and 126 a control diet. No significant differences was found in the number of renal deaths (RR 1.12, 95% CI 0.54 to 2.33), progression of kidney disease (creatinine clearance at two years: MD 1.47, 95% CI -1.19 to 4.14) or growth (weight - MD -0.13, 95% CI -1.10 to 0.84; height - MD -1.99, 95% CI -4.84 to 0.86).Authors' conclusions: Reducing protein intake does not appear to have significant impact in delaying the progression to ESKD in children.US: http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD006863/abstractRecord #29 of 271ID: CD009825AU: Rees KarenAU: Hartley LouiseAU: Flowers NadineAU: Clarke AileenAU: Hooper LeeAU: Thorogood MargaretAU: Stranges SaverioTI: 'Mediterranean' dietary pattern for the primary prevention of cardiovascular diseaseSO: Cochrane Database of Systematic ReviewsYR: 2013NO: 8PB: John Wiley & Sons, LtdKY: Diet, Mediterranean;Cardiovascular Diseases [blood] [prevention & control];Cholesterol [blood];Cholesterol, LDL [blood];Primary Prevention [methods];Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic;Adult[checkword];Humans[checkword]CC: VASCDOI: 10.1002/14651858.CD009825.pub2AB: Background: The Seven Countries study in the 1960s showed that populations in the Mediterranean region experienced lower cardiovascular disease (CVD) mortality probably as a result of different dietary patterns. Later observational studies have confirmed the benefits of adherence to a Mediterranean dietary pattern on CVD risk factors. Clinical trial evidence is limited, and is mostly in secondary prevention.Objectives: To determine the effectiveness of a Mediterranean dietary pattern for the primary prevention of CVD.Search methods: We searched the following electronic databases: the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, Issue 9 of 12, September 2012); MEDLINE (Ovid, 1946 to October week 1 2012); EMBASE (Ovid, 1980 to 2012 week 41); ISI Web of Science (1970 to 16 October 2012); Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects (DARE), Health Technology Assessment Database and Health Economics Evaluations Database (Issue 3 of 12, September 2012). We searched trial registers and reference lists of reviews and applied no language restrictions.Selection criteria: We selected randomised controlled trials in healthy adults and adults at high risk of CVD. A Mediterranean dietary pattern was defined as comprising at least two of the following components: (1) high monounsaturated/saturated fat ratio, (2) low to moderate red wine consumption, (3) high consumption of legumes, (4) high consumption of grains and cereals, (5) high consumption of fruits and vegetables, (6) low consumption of meat and meat products and increased consumption of fish, and (7) moderate consumption of milk and dairy products. The comparison group received either no intervention or minimal intervention. Outcomes included clinical events and CVD risk factors.Data collection and analysis: Two review authors independently extracted data and contacted chief investigators to request additional relevant information.Main results: We included 11 trials (15 papers) (52,044 participants randomised). Trials were heterogeneous in the participants recruited, in the number of dietary components and follow-up periods. Seven trials described the intervention as a Mediterranean diet. Clinical events were reported in only one trial (Women's Health Initiative 48,835 postmenopausal women, intervention not described as a Mediterranean diet but increased fruit and vegetable and cereal intake) where no statistically significant effects of the intervention were seen on fatal and non-fatal endpoints at eight years. Small reductions in total cholesterol (-0.16 mmol/L, 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.26 to -0.06; random-effects model) and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol (-0.07 mmol/L, 95% CI -0.13 to -0.01) were seen with the intervention. Subgroup analyses revealed statistically significant greater reductions in total cholesterol in those trials describing the intervention as a Mediterranean diet (-0.23 mmol/L, 95% CI -0.27 to -0.2) compared with control (-0.06 mmol/L, 95% CI -0.13 to 0.01). Heterogeneity precluded meta-analyses for other outcomes. Reductions in blood pressure were seen in three of five trials reporting this outcome. None of the trials reported adverse events.Authors' conclusions: The limited evidence to date suggests some favourable effects on cardiovascular risk factors.

Acute GI symptoms are associated with a greater risk of chronic, often debilitating, GI symptoms. Up to one-third of patients are malnourished before pelvic radiotherapy and up to four-fifths of patients lose weight during treatment. Malnutrition is linked to a higher risk of GI toxicity, which can lead to breaks in radiotherapy and early cessation of chemotherapy, thus compromising the efficacy of the primary cancer treatment.Objectives: To assess the effects of nutritional interventions for reducing GI toxicity in adults undergoing radical pelvic radiotherapy.Search methods: We searched the Cochrane Gynaecological Cancer Group's Trials Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), Issue 4, 2012, MEDLINE and EMBASE to May 2012. We handsearched the citation lists of included studies and previous systematic reviews identified to identify further relevant trials.Selection criteria: We included studies if they were randomised controlled trials (RCTs) or non-randomised studies with concurrent comparison groups including quasi-randomised trials, cluster RCTs, non-randomised trials, prospective and retrospective cohort studies, and case series of 30 or more patients. We only included studies if they assessed the effect of a nutritional intervention in adults aged 18 years or over undergoing radical pelvic radiotherapy as part of anticancer treatment for a primary pelvic malignancy. We excluded patients with stomas and a previous history of inflammatory bowel disease. Nutritional support interventions could be provided at any stage before or during pelvic radiotherapy and included dietary counselling; dietary modification of fibre, lactose or fat; supplementary foods or drinks or fortified foods; standard oral nutrition supplements including polymeric-, peptide- or amino acid-based supplements and those where novel substrates have been added; enteral tube feeds; or parenteral nutrition (partial or total). We excluded probiotics, prebiotics and synbiotics.Data collection and analysis: Two review authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. We contacted study authors to obtain missing data. We assessed bias for each of the included studies using the bias assessment tables in the Cochrane software Review Manager5. We performed meta-analysis, when indicated, using the Mantel-Haenszel fixed-effect method or inverse variance fixed-effect method displayed with heterogeneity. We undertook meta-analyses on trials evaluating dietary modification against standard treatment for diarrhoea at the end of radiotherapy and for change in weight from baseline to end of radiotherapy.Main results: The searches identified 7558 titles, and we excluded 7513 during title and abstract searches. We reviewed 45 papers in full, and excluded 39. We identified four studies on handsearching of the references, which, along with the six eligible papers from the database search, led to 10 studies being included. Four studies, three of which were RCTs and one prospective study, investigated the effect of elemental diet on GI symptoms; one RCT investigated the effect of dietary modification and elemental diet; and five RCTs investigated dietary modification. Studies were varied in terms of risk of bias. Data were dichotomised for presence and absence of diarrhoea at the end of radiotherapy for four trials evaluating dietary modification comprising modified fat, lactose, fibre or combinations of these dietary changes. A reduction in diarrhoea was demonstrated with nutritional intervention (risk ratio (RR) 0.66; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.51 to 0.87, four studies, 413 participants, moderate quality of evidence) with low heterogeneity (Chi2 = 3.50, I2 = 14%). Two trials evaluating dietary modification on weight change (comparing baseline and end of radiotherapy) showed no difference between intervention or control (mean difference (MD) -0.57 kg; 95% CI -1.22 to 0.09) with low heterogeneity (Chi2 = 1.41, I2 = 29%). Generally adverse effects were poorly reported in included studies. Elemental diet in particular was poorly tolerated. GI symptoms or toxicity > 6 months after radiotherapy was not reported in included studiesAuthors' conclusions: There have been benefits demonstrated with dietary modification during pelvic radiotherapy to reduce diarrhoea. Those diets included single interventions or combinations of modified fat, lactose-restriction, fat-restriction and fibre supplementation. We were unable to meta-analyse elemental diet, as data were not available. We considered some of the studies to be at high risk of bias. There have been recent advances in novel, more targeted radiotherapy techniques, such that the findings of older studies need to be interpreted with caution. In addition, there were problems with compliance and palatability with some of the interventions, particularly elemental diet, which limits its usefulness in clinical practice.US: http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD009896.pub2/abstractRecord #31 of 271ID: CD001507AU: Webster DianaAU: Wildgoose JoanneTI: Tyrosine supplementation for phenylketonuriaSO: Cochrane Database of Systematic ReviewsYR: 2013NO: 6PB: John Wiley & Sons, LtdKY: Dietary Supplements;Intelligence [drug effects];Neuropsychological Tests;Phenylalanine [blood];Phenylketonurias [blood] [diet therapy] [drug therapy];Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic;Tyrosine [blood] [therapeutic use];Humans[checkword]CC: CFDOI: 10.1002/14651858.CD001507.pub3AB: Background: Phenylketonuria is an inherited disease for which the main treatment is the dietary restriction of the amino acid phenylalanine. The diet has to be initiated in the neonatal period to prevent or reduce mental handicap. However, the diet is very restrictive and unpalatable and can be difficult to follow. A deficiency of the amino acid tyrosine has been suggested as a cause of some of the neuropsychological problems exhibited in phenylketonuria. Therefore, this review aims to assess the efficacy of tyrosine supplementation for phenylketonuria.Objectives: To assess the effects of tyrosine supplementation alongside or instead of a phenylalanine-restricted diet for people with phenylketonuria, who commenced on diet at diagnosis and either continued on the diet or relaxed the diet later in life. To assess the evidence that tyrosine supplementation alongside, or instead of a phenylalanine-restricted diet improves intelligence, neuropsychological performance, growth and nutritional status, mortality rate and quality of life.Search methods: We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group's Trials Register which is comprised of references identified from comprehensive electronic database searches, handsearches of relevant journals and abstract books of conference proceedings. Additional studies were identified from handsearches of the Journal of Inherited Metabolic Disease (from inception in 1978 to 1998). The manufacturers of prescribable dietary products used in the treatment of phenylketonuria were also contacted for further references.Date of the most recent search of the Group's Inborn Errors of Metabolism Trials Register: 28 June 2012.Selection criteria: All randomised or quasi-randomised trials investigating the use of tyrosine supplementation versus placebo in people with phenylketonuria in addition to, or instead of, a phenylalanine-restricted diet. People treated for maternal phenylketonuria were excluded.Data collection and analysis: Two authors independently assessed the trial eligibility, methodological quality and extracted the data.Main results: Six trials were found, of which three trials reporting the results of a total of 56 participants, were suitable for inclusion in the review. The blood tyrosine concentrations were significantly higher in the participants receiving tyrosine supplements than those in the placebo group, mean difference 23.46 (95% confidence interval 12.87 to 34.05). No significant differences were found between any of the other outcomes measured.Authors' conclusions: From the available evidence no recommendations can be made about whether tyrosine supplementation should be introduced into routine clinical practice. Further randomised controlled studies are required to provide more evidence.US: http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD001507.pub3/abstractRecord #32 of 271ID: CD010070AU: McMahon Emma JAU: Campbell Katrina LAU: Bauer Judith DAU: Mudge David WTI: Altered dietary salt intake for people with chronic kidney diseaseSO: Cochrane Database of Systematic ReviewsYR: 2015NO: 2PB: John Wiley & Sons, LtdKY: Diet, Sodium-Restricted;Antihypertensive Agents [administration & dosage];Blood Pressure [drug effects] [physiology];Edema [prevention & control];Hypertension [drug therapy];Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic;Renal Insufficiency, Chronic [diet therapy];Selection Bias;Sodium Chloride, Dietary [administration & dosage];Humans[checkword]DOI: 10.1002/14651858.CD010070.pub2AB: Background: Salt intake shows great promise as a modifiable risk factor for reducing heart disease incidence and delaying kidney function decline in people with chronic kidney disease (CKD). However, a clear consensus of the benefits of reducing salt in people with CKD is lacking.Objectives: This review evaluated the benefits and harms of altering dietary salt intake in people with CKD.Search methods: We searched the Cochrane Renal Group's Specialised Register to 13 January 2015 through contact with the Trials' Search Co-ordinator using search terms relevant to this review.Selection criteria: We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared two or more levels of salt intake in people with any stage of CKD.Data collection and analysis: Two authors independently assessed studies for eligibility and conducted risk of bias evaluation. Results were expressed as risk ratios (RR) and their 95% confidence intervals (CI) for dichotomous outcomes, and mean difference (MD) and 95% CI for continuous outcomes. Mean effect sizes were calculated using the random-effects models.Main results: We included eight studies (24 reports, 258 participants). Because duration of the included studies was too short (1 to 26 weeks) to test the effect of salt restriction on endpoints such as mortality, cardiovascular events or CKD progression, changes in salt intake on blood pressure and other secondary risk factors were applied. Three studies were parallel RCTs and five were cross-over studies. Selection bias was low in five studies and unclear in three. Performance and detection biases were low in two studies and unclear in six. Attrition and reporting biases were low in four studies and unclear in four. One study had the potential for high carryover effect; three had high risk of bias from baseline characteristics (change of medication or diet) and two studies were industry funded.There was a significant reduction in 24 hour sodium excretion associated with low salt interventions (range 52 to 141 mmol) (8 studies, 258 participants: MD -105.86 mmol/d, 95% CI -119.20 to -92.51; I2 = 51%). Reducing salt intake significantly reduced systolic blood pressure (8 studies, 258 participants: MD -8.75 mm Hg, 95% CI -11.33 to -6.16; I2 = 0%) and diastolic blood pressure (8 studies, 258 participants: MD -3.70 mm Hg, 95% CI -5.09 to -2.30; I2 = 0%). One study reported restricting salt intake reduced the risk of oedema by 56%. Salt restriction significantly increased plasma renin activity (2 studies, 71 participants: MD 1.08 ng/mL/h, 95% CI 0.51 to 1.65; I2 = 0%) and serum aldosterone (2 studies, 71 participants: 6.20 ng/dL (95% CI 3.82 to 8.58; I2 = 0%). Antihypertensive medication dosage was significantly reduced with a low salt diet (2 studies, 52 participants): RR 5.48, 95% CI 1.27 to 23.66; I2 = 0%). There was no significant difference in eGFR (2 studies, 68 participants: MD -1.14 mL/min/1.73 m2, 95% CI -4.38 to 2.11; I2 = 0%), creatinine clearance (3 studies, 85 participants): MD -4.60 mL/min, 95% CI -11.78 to 2.57; I2 = 0%), serum creatinine (5 studies, 151 participants: MD 5.14 µmol/L, 95% CI -8.98 to 19.26; I2 = 59%) or body weight (5 studies, 139 participants: MD -1.46 kg; 95% CI -4.55 to 1.64; I2 = 0%). There was no significant change in total cholesterol in relation to salt restriction (3 studies, 105 participants: MD -0.23 mmol/L, 95% CI -0.57 to 0.10; I2 = 0%) or symptomatic hypotension (2 studies, 72 participants: RR 6.60, 95% CI 0.77 to 56.55; I2 = 0%). Salt restriction significantly reduced urinary protein excretion in all studies that reported proteinuria as an outcome, however data could not be meta-analysed.Authors' conclusions: We found a critical evidence gap in long-term effects of salt restriction in people with CKD that meant we were unable to determine the direct effects of sodium restriction on primary endpoints such as mortality and progression to end-stage kidney disease (ESKD). We found that salt reduction in people with CKD reduced blood pressure considerably and consistently reduced proteinuria. If such reductions could be maintained long-term, this effect may translate to clinically significant reductions in ESKD incidence and cardiovascular events. Research into the long-term effects of sodium-restricted diet for people with CKD is warranted, as is investigation into adherence to a low salt diet.US: http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD010070.pub2/abstractRecord #33 of 271ID: CD002181AU: Robertson Lynn MAU: Waugh NormanAU: Robertson AileenTI: Protein restriction for diabetic renal diseaseSO: Cochrane Database of Systematic ReviewsYR: 2007NO: 4PB: John Wiley & Sons, LtdKY: Diet, Protein-Restricted;Diabetic Nephropathies [diet therapy];Dietary Proteins [administration & dosage];Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic;Renal Insufficiency [etiology] [prevention & control];Humans[checkword]CC: ENDOCDOI: 10.1002/14651858.CD002181.pub2AB: Background: Diabetic renal disease (diabetic nephropathy) is a leading cause of end-stage renal failure. Once the process has started, it cannot be reversed by glycaemic control, but progression might be slowed by control of blood pressure and protein restriction.Objectives: To assess the effects of dietary protein restriction on the progression of diabetic nephropathy in patients with diabetes.Search methods: We searched The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, EMBASE, ISI Proceedings, Science Citation Index Expanded and bibliographies of included studies.Selection criteria: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and before and after studies of the effects of a modified or restricted protein diet on diabetic renal function in people with type 1 or type 2 diabetes following diet for at least four months were considered.Data collection and analysis: Two reviewers performed data extraction and evaluation of quality independently. Pooling of results was done by means of random-effects model.Main results: Twelve studies were included, nine RCTs and three before and after studies. Only one study explored all-cause mortality and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) as endpoints. The relative risk (RR) of ESRD or death was 0.23 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.07 to 0.72) for patients assigned to a low protein diet (LPD). Pooling of the seven RCTs in patients with type 1 diabetes resulted in a non-significant reduction in the decline of glomerular filtration rate (GFR) of 0.1 ml/min/month (95% CI -0.1 to 0.3) in the LPD group. For type 2 diabetes, one trial showed a small insignificant improvement in the rate of decline of GFR in the protein-restricted group and a second found a similar decline in both the intervention and control groups. Actual protein intake in the intervention groups ranged from 0.7 to 1.1 g/kg/day. One study noted malnutrition in the LPD group. We found no data on the effects of LPDs on health-related quality of life and costs.Authors' conclusions: The results show that reducing protein intake appears to slightly slow progression to renal failure but not statistically significantly so. However, questions concerning the level of protein intake and compliance remain. Further longer-term research on large representative groups of patients with both type 1 and type 2 diabetes mellitus is necessary. Because of the variability amongst patients, there might perhaps be a six month therapeutic trial of protein restriction in all individuals, with continuation only in those who responded best. Trials are required of different types of protein.US: http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD002181.pub2/abstractRecord #34 of 271ID: CD008867AU: Bricker LeanneAU: Reed KeithAU: Wood LornaAU: Neilson James PTI: Nutritional advice for improving outcomes in multiple pregnanciesSO: Cochrane Database of Systematic ReviewsYR: 2015NO: 11PB: John Wiley & Sons, LtdKY: Weight Gain;Pregnancy, Multiple [physiology];Prenatal Nutritional Physiological Phenomena [physiology];Female[checkword];Humans[checkword];Pregnancy[checkword]CC: PREGDOI: 10.1002/14651858.CD008867.pub3AB: Background: Multiple pregnancies are associated with higher rates of perinatal mortality and morbidity than singleton pregnancies, mainly due to an increased risk of preterm birth. Because fetal outcome is best at a particular range of maternal weight gain, it has been suggested that women with multiple pregnancies should take special diets (particularly high-calorie diets) designed to boost weight gain. However, 'optimal weight gain' in the mother in retrospective studies may merely reflect good growth of her babies and delivery at or near term (both associated with a good outcome) and artificially boosting weight gain by nutritional input may confer no advantage. Indeed, a high-calorie diet may be unpleasant to consume, and could lead to long-term problems of being overweight. It is therefore important to establish if specialised diets are actually of benefit to women with multiple pregnancies and their babies.Objectives: To assess the effects of specialised diets or nutritional advice for women with multiple pregnancies (two or more fetuses).Search methods: We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (15 June 2015).Selection criteria: Randomised controlled trials, 'quasi-random' studies, and cluster-randomised trials of women with multiple pregnancies (two or more fetuses) either nulliparous or multiparous and their babies. Cross-over trials and studies reported only as abstracts were not eligible for inclusion.Data collection and analysis: We identified no trials for inclusion in this review.Main results: A comprehensive search of the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register found no potentially eligible trial reports.Authors' conclusions: There is no robust evidence from randomised trials to indicate whether specialised diets or nutritional advice for women with multiple pregnancies do more good than harm. There is a clear need to undertake a randomised controlled trial.US: http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD008867.pub3/abstractRecord #35 of 271ID: CD006122AU: Masters BronwenAU: Aarabi ShahramAU: Sidhwa FerozeAU: Wood FionaTI: High-carbohydrate, high-protein, low-fat versus low-carbohydrate, high-protein, high-fat enteral feeds for burnsSO: Cochrane Database of Systematic ReviewsYR: 2012NO: 1PB: John Wiley & Sons, LtdKY: Diet, Carbohydrate-Restricted;Diet, Fat-Restricted;Diet, High-Fat;Burns [diet therapy] [therapy];Dietary Carbohydrates [administration & dosage];Dietary Proteins [administration & dosage];Enteral Nutrition [methods];Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic;Humans[checkword]CC: INJDOI: 10.1002/14651858.CD006122.pub3AB: Background: Severe burn injuries increase patients' metabolic needs. Aggressive high-protein enteral feeding is used in the post-burn period to improve recovery and healing.Objectives: To examine the evidence for improved clinical outcomes in burn patients treated with high-carbohydrate, high-protein, low-fat enteral feeds (high-carbohydrate enteral feeds) compared with those treated with low-carbohydrate, high-protein, high-fat enteral enteral feeds (high-fat enteral feeds).Search methods: We searched the Cochrane Injuries Group Specialised Register (searched 28 Nov 2011), Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (The Cochrane Library 2011, Issue 4), MEDLINE (Ovid) 1950 to Nov (Week 3) 2011, EMBASE (Ovid), ISI Web of Science: Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED) (1970 to Nov 2011), ISI Web of Science: Conference Proceedings Citation Index-Science (CPCI-S) (1990 to Nov 2011), PubMed (Searched 28 Nov 2011). Online trials registers and conference proceedings were also searched to April 2010.Selection criteria: We included all randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing high-carbohydrate enteral feeds to high-fat enteral feeds for treatment of patients with 10% or greater total body surface area (TBSA) burns in the immediate post-burn period, with data for at least one of the pre-specified outcomes.Data collection and analysis: Two authors collected and analysed the following data: mortality, incidence of pneumonia and days on ventilator. Meta-analysis could only be performed for the outcomes mortality and incidence of pneumonia. A random-effects model was used for all comparisons.Main results: Two RCTs, reporting results from 93 patients, were included in this review. Patients given a high-carbohydrate feeding formula had an odds ratio (OR) of 0.12 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.04 to 0.39) for developing pneumonia compared to patients given a high-fat enteral formula (P value = 0.0004). Patients given a high-carbohydrate formula had an OR of 0.36 (95% CI 0.11 to 1.15) for risk of death compared to patients given a high-fat enteral formula; this difference did not reach statistical significance (P value = 0.08). Risk of bias in these studies was assessed as high and moderate.Authors' conclusions: The available evidence suggests that use of high-carbohydrate, high-protein, low-fat enteral feeds in patients with at least 10% TBSA burns might reduce the incidence of pneumonia compared with use of a low-carbohydrate, high-protein, high-fat diet. The available evidence is inconclusive regarding the effect of either enteral feeding regimen on mortality. Note that the available evidence is limited to two small studies judged to be of moderate risk of bias.

Epidemiological studies suggest a correlation between the onset of asthma and dietary nonallergic factors especially high calorie diet. These can be regarded as other potentially important risk factors.Objectives: To observe the effect of dietary calorie reduction on chronic asthma in adults or children.Search methods: We searched the Cochrane Airways Group Specialised Register of trials using prespecified terms. We assessed bibliographies from included studies, and contacted authors of known studies for additional information about published and unpublished trials. Date of most recent search: May 2006Selection criteria: Randomised-controlled trials of dietary calorie reduction were included.Data collection and analysis: Three authors assessed each study independently. Disagreement was resolved by consensus. Quality assessment was performed independently.Main results: One trial of fair methodological quality with a total of 38 patients suffering from chronic asthma was included. There were significant increases in FEV1 and FVC in the active treatment group compared with control. No data pertaining serious adverse effects were reported from the interventions.Authors' conclusions: There is currently a very small amount of evidence assessing the effects of dietary interventions intended as part of a wide-ranging weight-loss programme. Whilst we are unable to recommend these strategies as concomitant interventions with drug-based therapy for the specific management of asthma, dietary interventions such as weight-loss programmes may provide benefits in specific patients. However, the impact of a calorie-controlled diet on the signs and symptoms of asthma in the general asthmatic population is yet to be established.US: http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD004674.pub2/abstractRecord #37 of 271ID: CD003656AU: Hooper LeeAU: Bartlett ChristopherAU: Davey Smith GeorgeAU: Ebrahim ShahTI: Advice to reduce dietary salt for prevention of cardiovascular diseaseSO: Cochrane Database of Systematic ReviewsYR: 2004NO: 1PB: John Wiley & Sons, LtdKY: Antihypertensive Agents [therapeutic use];Cardiovascular Diseases [prevention & control];Diet, Sodium-Restricted;Hypertension [diet therapy] [drug therapy];Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic;Sodium Chloride, Dietary [administration & dosage];Humans[checkword]CC: HTNDOI: 10.1002/14651858.CD003656.pub2AB: Background: Restricting sodium intake in hypertensive patients over short periods of time reduces blood pressure. Long term effects (on mortality, morbidity or blood pressure) of advice to reduce salt in patients with elevated or normal blood pressure are unclear.Objectives: To assess in adults the long term effects (mortality, cardiovascular events, blood pressure, quality of life, weight, urinary sodium excretion, other nutrients and use of anti-hypertensive medications) of advice to restrict dietary sodium using all relevant randomised controlled trials.Search methods: The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, EMBASE, bibliographies of included studies and related systematic reviews were searched for unconfounded randomised trials in healthy adults aiming to reduce sodium intake over at least 6 months. Attempts were made to trace unpublished or missed studies and authors of all included trials were contacted. There were no language restrictions.Selection criteria: Inclusion decisions were independently duplicated and based on the following criteria: 1) randomisation was adequate; 2) there was a usual or control diet group; 3) the intervention aimed to reduce sodium intake; 4) the intervention was not multifactorial; 5) the participants were not children, acutely ill, pregnant or institutionalised; 6) follow-up was at least 26 weeks; 7) data on any of the outcomes of interest were available.Data collection and analysis: Decisions on validity and data extraction were made independently by two reviewers, disagreements were resolved by discussion or if necessary by a third reviewer. Random effects meta-analysis, sub-grouping, sensitivity analysis and meta-regression were performed.Main results: Three trials in normotensives (n=2326), five in untreated hypertensives (n=387) and three in treated hypertensives (n=801) were included, with follow up from six months to seven years. The large, high quality (and therefore most informative) studies used intensive behavioural interventions.Deaths and cardiovascular events were inconsistently defined and reported; only 17 deaths equally distributed between intervention and control groups occurred. Systolic and diastolic blood pressures were reduced at 13 to 60 months in those given low sodium advice as compared with controls (systolic by 1.1 mm Hg, 95% CI 1.8 to 0.4, diastolic by 0.6 mm hg, 95% CI 1.5 to -0.3), as was urinary 24 hour sodium excretion (by 35.5 mmol/ 24 hours, 95% CI 47.2 to 23.9). Degree of reduction in sodium intake and change in blood pressure were not related. People on anti-hypertensive medications were able to stop their medication more often on a reduced sodium diet as compared with controls, while maintaining similar blood pressure control.Authors' conclusions: Intensive interventions, unsuited to primary care or population prevention programmes, provide only minimal reductions in blood pressure during long-term trials. Further evaluations to assess effects on morbidity and mortality outcomes are needed for populations as a whole and for patients with elevated blood pressure.A low sodium diet may help in maintenance of lower blood pressure following withdrawal of antihypertensives. If this is confirmed, with no increase in cardiovascular events, then targeting of comprehensive dietary and behavioural programmes in patients with elevated blood pressure requiring drug treatment would be justified.US: http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD003656.pub2/abstractRecord #38 of 271ID: CD010350AU: Liu ZhuangzhuAU: Su GuobinAU: Guo XinfengAU: Wu YifanAU: Liu XushengAU: Zou ChuanAU: Zhang LeiAU: Yang QianchunAU: Xu YuanAU: Ma WeizhongTI: Dietary interventions for mineral and bone disorder in people with chronic kidney diseaseSO: Cochrane Database of Systematic ReviewsYR: 2015NO: 9PB: John Wiley & Sons, LtdKY: Bread;Acetates [administration & dosage];Alkaline Phosphatase [blood];Bone Density;Bone Diseases, Metabolic [blood] [etiology] [therapy];Calcium [blood];Calcium Compounds [administration & dosage];Calcium Phosphates [blood];Calcium, Dietary [administration & dosage];Dietary Proteins [administration & dosage];Hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA Reductase Inhibitors [administration & dosage];Phosphorus [administration & dosage] [blood];Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic;Renal Insufficiency, Chronic [complications];Humans[checkword]CC: RENALDOI: 10.1002/14651858.CD010350.pub2AB: Background: Chronic kidney disease-mineral and bone disorder (CKD-MBD) is a systemic dysfunction of mineral and bone metabolism in people with CKD. Recent research shows that phosphate retention plays a significant role in the development of CKD-MBD. Compared with drug therapies, dietary interventions may be simple, inexpensive and feasible for phosphate retention. However, there is little evidence to support these interventions.Objectives: Our objective was to assess the benefits and harms of any dietary intervention for preventing and treating CKD-MBD.Search methods: We searched Cochrane Kidney and Transplant's Specialised Register to 27 August 2015 through contact with the Trials' Search Co-ordinator using search terms relevant to this review. We also searched the Chinese Biomedicine Database (CBM) (1976 to August 2015), China Knowledge Resource Integrated Database (CNKI) (1979 to August 2015), and VIP (1989 to August 2015).Selection criteria: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs looking at dietary interventions for prevention or treatment of CKD-MBD were eligible for inclusion.Data collection and analysis: Two authors independently assessed the eligibility, methodological quality, and extracted data. Continuous outcomes (serum calcium level, serum phosphorus level, calcium × phosphate product, parathyroid hormone (PTH), fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF-23) and alkaline phosphatase) were expressed as mean difference (MD) with 95% confidence interval (CI). Dichotomous outcomes (mortality) were expressed as risk ratio (RR) with 95% CI. We used a random-effects model to meta-analyse studies.Main results: Nine studies were included in this review which analysed 634 participants. Study duration ranged from 4 to 24 weeks. The interventions included calcium-enriched bread, low phosphorus intake, low protein intake, very low protein intake, post haemodialysis supplements and hypolipaemic diet. Only one study reported death; none of the included studies reported cardiovascular events or fractures. There was insufficient reporting of design and methodological aspects among the included studies to enable robust assessment of risk of bias.There was limited and low-quality evidence to indicate that calcium-enriched bread increased serum calcium (1 study, 53 participants: MD -0.16 mmol/L, 95% CI -0.51 to -0.31), decreased serum phosphorus (53 participants: MD -0.41 mmol/L, 95% CI -0.51 to -0.31) and decreased the calcium × phosphate product (53 participants: MD -0.62 mmol²/L², 95% CI -0.77 to -0.47).Very low protein intake was not superior to conventional low protein intake in terms of effect on serum phosphorus (2 studies, 41 participants: MD -0.12 mmol/L, 95% CI -0.50 to 0.25), serum calcium (MD 0.00 mmol/L, 95% CI -0.17 to 0.17), or alkaline phosphatase (MD -22.00 U/L, 95% CI -78.25 to 34.25). PTH was significantly lower in the very low protein intake group (2 studies, 41 participants: MD -69.64 pmol/L, 95% CI -139.83 to 0.54).One study reported no significant difference in the number of deaths between low phosphorus intake and normal diet (279 participants: RR 0.18, 95% CI 0.01 to 3.82). Low phosphorus intake decreased serum phosphorus (2 studies, 359 participants: MD -0.18 mmol/L, 95% CI -0.29 to -0.07; I2 = 0%).One study reported post-haemodialysis supplements did not increase serum phosphorus compared to normal diet (40 participants: MD 0.12 mmol/L, 95% CI -0.24 to 0.49).One study reported low phosphorus intake plus lanthanum carbonate significantly decreased FGF-23 (19 participants: MD -333.80 RU/mL, 95% CI -526.60 to -141.00), but did not decrease serum phosphorus (19 participants: MD -0.10 mg/dL, 95% CI -0.38 to 0.58) or PTH (19 participants: MD 31.60 pg/mL, 95% CI -29.82 to 93.02).Authors' conclusions: There was limited low quality evidence to indicate that dietary interventions (calcium-enriched bread or low phosphorus/protein intake) may positively affect CKD-MBD by increasing serum calcium, decreasing serum phosphorus, the calcium × phosphate product and FGF-23. Large and well-designed RCTs are needed to evaluate the effects of various interventions for people with CKD-MBD.US: http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD010350.pub2/abstractRecord #39 of 271ID: CD005984AU: Akobeng Anthony KAU: Thomas Adrian GTI: Enteral nutrition for maintenance of remission in Crohn's diseaseSO: Cochrane Database of Systematic ReviewsYR: 2007NO: 3PB: John Wiley & Sons, LtdKY: Enteral Nutrition;Crohn Disease [prevention & control] [therapy];Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic;Secondary Prevention;Humans[checkword]CC: IBDDOI: 10.1002/14651858.CD005984.pub2AB: Background: Prevention of relapse is a major issue in the management of Crohn's disease. Corticosteroids and 5-ASA preparations are not effective for the maintenance of remission. Methotrexate, infliximab, 6-mercaptopurine and its prodrug, azathioprine may be effective in maintaining remission, but these drugs may cause significant adverse events.Objectives: To conduct a systematic review to evaluate the efficacy of enteral nutrition for the maintenance of remission in Crohn's disease.Search methods: MEDLINE (1966 to January 2007), EMBASE (1984 to January 2007) the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials from the Cochrane Library (Issue 4, 2006) and the IBD/FBD Review Group Specialized Trials Register were searched. The articles cited in each publication were hand searched.Selection criteria: Randomised controlled trials which compared enteral nutrition with no intervention, placebo or with any other intervention were eligible for inclusion.Data collection and analysis: Data extraction and assessment of methodological quality of included studies were independently performed by two authors. The main outcome measure was the occurrence of clinical or endoscopic relapse as defined by the primary studies. Odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals were calculated for dichotomous outcomes.Main results: Two studies were identified that met the inclusion criteria and were included in the review. Statistical pooling of the results of these studies was not possible because the control interventions, and the way outcomes were assessed differed greatly between the two studies. In one study (Takagi 2006), patients who received half of their total daily calorie requirements as elemental diet and the remaining half by normal diet had a significantly lower relapse rate compared to patients who received unrestricted normal diet (9 of 26 versus 16 of 25; OR 0.3, 95% CI 0.09 to 0.94). In the other study (Verma 2001), elemental and polymeric feeds (providing between 35 and 50% of patients' pretrial calorie intake in addition to unrestricted normal food) were equally effective for maintenance of remission and allowing withdrawal of steroid therapy (8 of 19 versus 6 of 14; OR 0.97, 95% CI 0.24 to 3.92).Authors' conclusions: The available evidence suggests that supplementary enteral nutritional may be effective for maintenance of remission in Crohn's disease. Whilst larger studies are needed to confirm these findings, enteral nutritional supplementation could be considered as an alternative or as an adjunct to maintenance drug therapy in Crohn's disease.US: http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD005984.pub2/abstractRecord #40 of 271ID: CD006540AU: Harris RebeccaAU: Gamboa AnaAU: Dailey YvonneAU: Ashcroft AngelaTI: One-to-one dietary interventions undertaken in a dental setting to change dietary behaviourSO: Cochrane Database of Systematic ReviewsYR: 2012NO: 3PB: John Wiley & Sons, LtdKY: Alcohol Drinking [prevention & control];Carbonated Beverages [adverse effects];Dental Care [methods];Dental Caries [prevention & control];Dietary Carbohydrates [administration & dosage] [adverse effects];Feeding Behavior [psychology];Fruit;Oral Hygiene [education];Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic;Vegetables;Adolescent[checkword];Adult[checkword];Aged[checkword];Aged, 80 and over[checkword];Child[checkword];Humans[checkword];Middle Aged[checkword]DOI: 10.1002/14651858.CD006540.pub2AB: Background: The dental care setting is an appropriate place to deliver dietary assessment and advice as part of patient management. However, we do not know whether this is effective in changing dietary behaviour.Objectives: To assess the effectiveness of one-to-one dietary interventions for all ages carried out in a dental care setting in changing dietary behaviour. The effectiveness of these interventions in the subsequent changing of oral and general health is also assessed.Search methods: The following electronic databases were searched: the Cochrane Oral Health Group Trials Register (to 24 January 2012), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library 2012, Issue 1), MEDLINE via OVID (1950 to 24 January 2012), EMBASE via OVID (1980 to 24 January 2012), CINAHL via EBSCO (1982 to 24 January 2012), PsycINFO via OVID (1967 to 24 January 2012), and Web of Science (1945 to 12 April 2011). We also undertook an electronic search of key conference proceedings (IADR and ORCA between 2000 and 13 July 2011). Reference lists of relevant articles, thesis publications (Dissertations Abstracts Online 1861 to 2011) were searched. The authors of eligible trials were contacted to identify any unpublished work.Selection criteria: Randomised controlled trials assessing the effectiveness of one-to-one dietary interventions delivered in a dental care setting.Data collection and analysis: Abstract screening, eligibility screening and data extraction decisions were all carried out independently and in duplicate by two review authors. Consensus between the two opinions was achieved by discussion, or involvement of a third review author.Main results: Five studies met the criteria for inclusion in the review. Two of these were multi-intervention studies where the dietary intervention was one component of a wider programme of prevention, but where data on dietary behaviour change were reported. One of the single intervention studies was concerned with dental caries prevention. The other two concerned general health outcomes. There were no studies concerned with dietary change aimed at preventing tooth erosion. In four out of the five included studies a significant change in dietary behaviour was found for at least one of the primary outcome variables.Authors' conclusions: There is some evidence that one-to-one dietary interventions in the dental setting can change behaviour, although the evidence is greater for interventions aiming to change fruit/vegetable and alcohol consumption than for those aiming to change dietary sugar consumption. There is a need for more studies, particularly in the dental practice setting, as well as greater methodological rigour in the design, statistical analysis and reporting of such studies.US: http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD006540.pub2/abstractRecord #41 of 271ID: CD003817AU: Shaw Kelly AAU: Gennat Hanni CAU: O'Rourke PeterAU: Del Mar ChrisTI: Exercise for overweight or obesitySO: Cochrane Database of Systematic ReviewsYR: 2006NO: 4PB: John Wiley & Sons, LtdKY: Diet, Reducing;Exercise;Obesity [therapy];Overweight;Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic;Weight Loss;Adult[checkword];Humans[checkword]CC: ENDOCDOI: 10.1002/14651858.CD003817.pub3AB: Background: Clinical trials have shown that exercise in adults with overweight or obesity can reduce bodyweight. There has been no quantitative systematic review of this in The Cochrane Library.Objectives: To assess exercise as a means of achieving weight loss in people with overweight or obesity, using randomised controlled clinical trials.Search methods: Studies were obtained from computerised searches of multiple electronic bibliographic databases.Selection criteria: Studies were included if they were randomised controlled trials that examined body weight change using one or more physical activity intervention in adults with overweight or obesity at baseline and loss to follow-up of participants of less than 15%.Data collection and analysis: Two authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data.Main results: The 43 studies included 3476 participants. Although significant heterogeneity in some of the main effects' analyses limited ability to pool effect sizes across some studies, a number of pooled effect sizes were calculated. When compared with no treatment, exercise resulted in small weight losses across studies. Exercise combined with diet resulted in a greater weight reduction than diet alone (WMD - 1.0 kg; 95% confidence interval (CI) -1.3 to -0.7). Increasing exercise intensity increased the magnitude of weight loss (WMD - 1.5 kg; 95% CI -2.3 to -0.7). There were significant differences in other outcome measures such as serum lipids, blood pressure and fasting plasma glucose. Exercise as a sole weight loss intervention resulted in significant reductions in diastolic blood pressure (WMD - 2 mmHg; 95% CI -4 to -1), triglycerides (WMD - 0.2 mmol/L; 95% CI -0.3 to -0.1) and fasting glucose (WMD - 0.2 mmol/L; 95% CI -0.3 to -0.1). Higher intensity exercise resulted in greater reduction in fasting serum glucose than lower intensity exercise (WMD - 0.3 mmol/L; 95% CI -0.5 to -0.2). No data were identified on adverse events, quality of life, morbidity, costs or on mortality.Authors' conclusions: The results of this review support the use of exercise as a weight loss intervention, particularly when combined with dietary change. Exercise is associated with improved cardiovascular disease risk factors even if no weight is lost.US: http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD003817.pub3/abstractRecord #42 of 271ID: CD007348AU: Akobeng Anthony KAU: Elawad MamounAU: Gordon MorrisTI: Glutamine for induction of remission in Crohn's diseaseSO: Cochrane Database of Systematic ReviewsYR: 2016NO: 2PB: John Wiley & Sons, LtdKY: Crohn Disease [drug therapy];Glutamine [therapeutic use];Induction Chemotherapy [methods];Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic;Adolescent[checkword];Adult[checkword];Child[checkword];Humans[checkword]CC: IBDDOI: 10.1002/14651858.CD007348.pub2AB: Background: Crohn's disease is a chronic relapsing condition of the alimentary tract with a high morbidity secondary to bowel inflammation. Glutamine plays a key role in maintaining the integrity of the intestinal mucosa and has been shown to reduce inflammation and disease activity in experimental models of Crohn's disease.Objectives: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of glutamine supplementation for induction of remission in Crohn's disease.Search methods: We searched the following databases from inception to November 15, 2015: MEDLINE, EMBASE, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and the Cochrane IBD Group Specialised Register. Study references were also searched for additional trials. There were no language restrictions.Selection criteria: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared glutamine supplementation administered by any route to a placebo, active comparator or no intervention in people with active Crohn's disease were considered for inclusion.Data collection and analysis: Two authors independently extracted data and assessed the methodological quality of the included studies. The Cochrane risk of bias tool was used to assess methodological quality. The primary outcome measure was clinical or endoscopic remission. Secondary outcomes included intestinal permeability, clinical response, quality of life, growth in children and adverse events. Risk ratios and 95% confidence intervals were calculated for dichotomous outcomes. The overall quality of the evidence supporting the primary outcome was evaluated using the GRADE criteria.Main results: Two small RCTs (total 42 patients) met the inclusion criteria and were included in the review. One study (18 patients) compared four weeks of treatment with a glutamine-enriched polymeric diet (42% amino acid composition) to a standard polymeric diet (4% amino acid composition) with low glutamine content in paediatric patients (< 18 years of age) with active Crohn's disease. The other study (24 patients) compared glutamine-supplemented total parenteral nutrition to non-supplemented total parenteral nutrition in adult patients (> 18 years of age) with acute exacerbation of inflammatory bowel disease. The paediatric study was rated as low risk of bias. The study in adult patients was rated as unclear risk of bias for blinding and low risk of bias for all other items. It was not possible to pool data for meta-analysis because of significant differences in study populations, nature of interventions, and the way outcomes were assessed. Data from one study showed no statistically significant difference in clinical remission rates at four weeks. Forty-four per cent (4/9) of patients who received a glutamine-enriched polymeric diet achieved remission compared to 56% (5/9) of patients who received a standard low-glutamine polymeric diet (RR 0.80, 95% CI 0.31 to 2.04). A GRADE analysis indicated that the overall quality of evidence for this outcome was low due to serious imprecision (9 events). In both included studies, no statistically significant changes in intestinal permeability were found between patients who received glutamine supplementation and those who did not. Neither study reported on clinical response, quality of life or growth in children. Adverse event data were not well documented. There were no serious adverse events in the paediatric study. The study in adult patients reported three central catheter infections with positive blood cultures in the glutamine group compared to none in the control group (RR 7.00, 95% CI 0.40 to 122.44).Authors' conclusions: Currently there is insufficient evidence to allow firm conclusions regarding the efficacy and safety of glutamine for induction of remission in Crohn's disease. Data from two small studies suggest that glutamine supplementation may not be beneficial in active Crohn's disease but these results need to be interpreted with caution as they are based on small numbers of patients. This review highlights the need for adequately powered randomised controlled trials to investigate the efficacy and safety of glutamine for induction of remission in Crohn's disease.US: http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD007348.pub2/abstractRecord #43 of 271ID: CD009584AU: Lazzerini MarziaAU: Rubert LauraAU: Pani PaolaTI: Specially formulated foods for treating children with moderate acute malnutrition in low- and middle-income countriesSO: Cochrane Database of Systematic ReviewsYR: 2013NO: 6PB: John Wiley & Sons, LtdKY: Developing Countries;Africa;Bangladesh;Dietary Fats [administration & dosage];Dietary Supplements [adverse effects] [supply & distribution];Food, Formulated [adverse effects] [standards];Malnutrition [diet therapy] [mortality];Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic;Child, Preschool[checkword];Female[checkword];Humans[checkword];Infant[checkword];Male[checkword]CC: BEHAVDOI: 10.1002/14651858.CD009584.pub2AB: Background: Moderate acute malnutrition, also called moderate wasting, affects around 10% of children under five years of age in low- and middle-income countries. There are different approaches to addressing malnutrition with prepared foods in these settings; for example, providing lipid-based nutrient supplements or blended foods, either a full daily dose or in a low dose as a complement to the usual diet. There is no definitive consensus on the most effective way to treat children with moderate acute malnutrition.Objectives: To evaluate the safety and effectiveness of different types of specially formulated foods for children with moderate acute malnutrition in low- and middle-income countries, and to assess whether foods complying or not complying with specific nutritional compositions, such as the WHO technical specifications, are safe and effective.Search methods: In October 2012, we searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, LILACS, CINAHL, BIBLIOMAP, POPLINE, ZETOC, ICTRP, mRCT, and ClinicalTrials.gov. In August 2012, we searched Embase. We also searched the reference lists of relevant papers and contacted nutrition-related organisations and researchers in this field.    Selection criteria: We planned to included any relevant randomised controlled trials (RCTs), controlled clinical trials (CCTs), controlled before-and-after studies (CBAs), and interrupted time series (ITS) that evaluated specially formulated foods for the treatment of moderate acute malnutrition in children aged between six months and five years in low- and middle-income countries.Data collection and analysis: Two authors assessed trial eligibility and risk of bias, and extracted and analysed the data. We summarised dichotomous outcomes using risk ratios (RR) and continuous outcomes using mean differences (MD) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Where appropriate, we combined data in meta-analyses using the random-effects model and assessed heterogeneity. The quality of evidence was assessed using GRADE methods.Main results: Eight randomised controlled trials, enrolling 10,037 children, met our inclusion criteria. Seven of the trials were conducted in Africa. In general, the included studies were at a low risk of bias. There may have been a risk of performance bias as trial participants were aware which intervention group they were in, but we did not consider this likely to have biased the outcome measurement. We were unable to assess the risk of reporting bias in half of the trials and two trials were at high risk of attrition bias. Any specially formulated food versus standard care - the provision of food increased the recovery rate by 29% (RR 1.29, 95% CI 1.20 to 1.38; 2152 children, two trials; moderate quality evidence), decreased the number dropping out by 70% (RR 0.30, 95% CI 0.22 to 0.39; 1974 children, one trial; moderate quality evidence), and improved weight-for-height (MD 0.20 z-score, 95% CI 0.03 to 0.37; 1546 children, two trials; moderate quality evidence). The reduction in mortality did not reach statistical significance (RR 0.44; 95% CI 0.14 to 1.36; 1974 children, one trial; low quality evidence). Lipid-based nutrient supplements versus any blended foods (dry food mixtures, without high lipid content), at full doses - there was no significant difference in mortality (RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.54 to 1.62; 6367 children, five trials; moderate quality evidence), progression to severe malnutrition (RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.72 to 1.07; 4537 children, three trials; high quality evidence), or the number of dropouts from the nutritional programme (RR 1.14, 95% CI 0.62 to 2.11; 5107 children, four trials; moderate quality evidence). However, lipid-based nutrient supplements significantly increased the number of children recovered (RR 1.10, 95% CI 1.04 to 1.16; 6367 children, five trials; moderate quality evidence), and decreased the number of non-recovering children (RR 0.53, 95% CI 0.40 to 0.69; 4537 children, three trials; high quality evidence). LNS also improved weight gain, weight-for-height, and mid-upper arm circumference, although for these outcomes, the improvement was modest (moderate quality evidence). One trial observed more children with vomiting in the lipid-based nutrient supplements group compared to those receiving blended food (RR 1.43, 95% CI 1.11 to 1.85; 2712 children, one trial; low quality evidence). Foods at complementary doses - no firm conclusion could be drawn on the comparisons between LNS at complementary dose and blended foods at complementary or full dose (low quality evidence). Lipid-based nutrient supplements versus specific types of blended foods - a recently developed enriched blended food (CSB++) resulted in similar outcomes to LNS (4758 children, three trials; moderate to high quality evidence). Different types of blended foods - in one trial, CSB++ did not show any significant benefit over locally made blended food, for example, Misola, in number who recovered, number who died, or weight gain (moderate to high quality evidence). Improved adequacy of home diet - no study evaluated the impact of improving adequacy of local diet, such as local foods prepared at home according to a given recipe or of home processing of local foods (soaking, germination, malting, fermentation) in order to increase their nutritional content.Authors' conclusions: In conclusion, there is moderate to high quality evidence that both lipid-based nutrient supplements and blended foods are effective in treating children with MAM. Although lipid-based nutrient supplements (LNS) led to a clinically significant benefit in the number of children recovered in comparison with blended foods, LNS did not reduce mortality, the risk of default or progression to SAM. It also induced more vomiting. Blended foods such as CSB++ may be equally effective and cheaper than LNS. Most of the research so far has focused on industrialised foods, and on short-term outcomes of MAM. There are no studies evaluating interventions to improve the quality of the home diet, an approach that should be evaluated in settings where food is available, and nutritional education and habits are the main determinants of malnutrition. There are no studies from Asia, where moderate acute malnutrition is most prevalent.US: http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD009584.pub2/abstractRecord #44 of 271ID: CD008066AU: Mastellos NikolaosAU: Gunn Laura HAU: Felix Lambert MAU: Car JosipAU: Majeed AzeemTI: Transtheoretical model stages of change for dietary and physical exercise modification in weight loss management for overweight and obese adultsSO: Cochrane Database of Systematic ReviewsYR: 2014NO: 2PB: John Wiley & Sons, LtdKY: Diet, Reducing;Exercise;Models, Psychological;Weight Loss;Health Behavior;Obesity [psychology] [therapy];Overweight [psychology] [therapy];Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic;Adult[checkword];Humans[checkword]DOI: 10.1002/14651858.CD008066.pub3AB: Background: Obesity is a global public health threat. The transtheoretical stages of change (TTM SOC) model has long been considered a useful interventional approach in lifestyle modification programmes, but its effectiveness in producing sustainable weight loss in overweight and obese individuals has been found to vary considerably. Objectives: To assess the effectiveness of dietary intervention or physical activity interventions, or both, and other interventions based on the transtheoretical model (TTM) stages of change (SOC) to produce sustainable (one year and longer) weight loss in overweight and obese adults.Search methods: Studies were obtained from searches of multiple electronic bibliographic databases. We searched The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, EMBASE and PsycINFO. The date of the last search, for all databases, was 17 December 2013.Selection criteria: Trials were included if they fulfilled the criteria of randomised controlled clinical trials (RCTs) using the TTM SOC as a model, that is a theoretical framework or guideline in designing lifestyle modification strategies, mainly dietary and physical activity interventions, versus a comparison intervention of usual care; one of the outcome measures of the study was weight loss, measured as change in weight or body mass index (BMI); participants were overweight or obese adults only; and the intervention was delivered by healthcare professionals or trained lay people at the hospital and community level, including at home.Data collection and analysis: Two review authors independently extracted the data, assessed studies for risk of bias and evaluated overall study quality according to GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation). We resolved disagreements by discussion or consultation with a third party. A narrative, descriptive analysis was conducted for the systematic review.Main results: A total of three studies met the inclusion criteria, allocating 2971 participants to the intervention and control groups. The total number of participants randomised to the intervention groups was 1467, whilst 1504 were randomised to the control groups. The length of intervention was 9, 12 and 24 months in the different trials. The use of TTM SOC in combination with diet or physical activity, or both, and other interventions in the included studies produced inconclusive evidence that TTM SOC interventions led to sustained weight loss (the mean difference between intervention and control groups varied from 2.1 kg to 0.2 kg at 24 months; 2971 participants; 3 trials; low quality evidence). Following application of TTM SOC there were improvements in physical activity and dietary habits, such as increased exercise duration and frequency, reduced dietary fat intake and increased fruit and vegetable consumption (very low quality evidence). Weight gain was reported as an adverse event in one of the included trials. None of the trials reported health-related quality of life, morbidity, or economic costs as outcomes. The small number of studies and their variable methodological quality limit the applicability of the findings to clinical practice. The main limitations include inadequate reporting of outcomes and the methods for allocation, randomisation and blinding; extensive use of self-reported measures to estimate the effects of interventions on a number of outcomes, including weight loss, dietary consumption and physical activity levels; and insufficient assessment of sustainability due to lack of post-intervention assessments.Authors' conclusions: The evidence to support the use of TTM SOC in weight loss interventions is limited by risk of bias and imprecision, not allowing firm conclusions to be drawn. When combined with diet or physical activity, or both, and other interventions we found very low quality evidence that it might lead to better dietary and physical activity habits. This systematic review highlights the need for well-designed RCTs that apply the principles of the TTM SOC appropriately to produce conclusive evidence about the effect of TTM SOC lifestyle interventions on weight loss and other health outcomes.US: http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD008066.pub3/abstractRecord #45 of 271ID: CD009000AU: Schoonees AnelAU: Lombard MartaniAU: Musekiwa AlfredAU: Nel EtienneAU: Volmink JimmyTI: Ready-to-use therapeutic food for home-based treatment of severe acute malnutrition in children from six months to five years of ageSO: Cochrane Database of Systematic ReviewsYR: 2013NO: 6PB: John Wiley & Sons, LtdKY: Fast Foods;Acute Disease;Malawi;Malnutrition [diet therapy] [mortality];Publication Bias;Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic;Recurrence;Child, Preschool[checkword];Humans[checkword];Infant[checkword]CC: BEHAVDOI: 10.1002/14651858.CD009000.pub2AB: Background: Malnourished children have a higher risk of death and illness. Treating severe acute malnourished children in hospitals is not always desirable or practical in rural settings, and home treatment may be better. Home treatment can be food prepared by the carer, such as flour porridge, or commercially manufactured food such as ready-to-use therapeutic food (RUTF). RUTF is made according to a standard, energy-rich composition defined by the World Health Organization (WHO). The benefits of RUTF include a low moisture content, long shelf life without needing refrigeration and that it requires no preparation.Objectives: To assess the effects of home-based RUTF on recovery, relapse and mortality in children with severe acute malnutrition.Search methods: We searched the following electronic databases up to April 2013: Cochrane Central Register of Clinical Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, MEDLINE In-process, EMBASE, CINAHL, Science Citation Index, African Index Medicus, LILACS, ZETOC and three trials registers. We also contacted researchers and clinicians in the field and handsearched bibliographies of included studies and relevant reviews.Selection criteria: We included randomised and quasi-randomised controlled trials where children between six months and five years of age with severe acute malnutrition were treated at home with RUTF compared to a standard diet, or different regimens and formulations of RUTFs compared to each other. We assessed recovery, relapse and mortality as primary outcomes, and anthropometrical changes, time to recovery and adverse outcomes as secondary outcomes.Data collection and analysis: Two review authors independently assessed trial eligibility using prespecified criteria, and three review authors independently extracted data and assessed trial risk of bias.Main results: We included four trials (three having a high risk of bias), all conducted in Malawi with the same contact author. One small trial included children infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). We found the risk of bias to be high for the three quasi-randomised trials while the fourth trial had a low to moderate risk of bias. Because of the sparse data for HIV, we reported below the main results for all children together. RUTF meeting total daily requirements versus standard dietWhen comparing RUTF with standard diet (flour porridge), we found three quasi-randomised cluster trials (n = 599). RUTF may improve recovery slightly (risk ratio (RR) 1.32; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.16 to 1.50; low quality evidence), but we do not know whether RUTF improves relapse, mortality or weight gain (very low quality evidence). RUTF supplement versus RUTF meeting total daily requirementsWhen comparing RUTF supplement with RUTF that meets total daily nutritional requirements, we found two quasi-randomised cluster trials (n = 210). For recovery, relapse, mortality and weight gain the quality of evidence was very low; therefore, the effects of RUTF are unknown. RUTF containing less milk powder versus standard RUTFWhen comparing a cheaper RUTF containing less milk powder (10%) versus standard RUTF (25% milk powder), we found one trial that randomised 1874 children. For recovery, there was probably little or no difference between the groups (RR 0.97; 95% CI 0.93 to 1.01; moderate quality evidence). RUTF containing less milk powder may lead to slightly more children relapsing (RR 1.33; 95% CI 1.03 to 1.72; low quality evidence) and to less weight gain (mean difference (MD) -0.5 g/kg/day; 95% CI -0.75 to -0.25; low-quality evidence) than standard RUTF. We do not know whether the cheaper RUTF improved mortality (very low quality evidence).Authors' conclusions: Given the limited evidence base currently available, it is not possible to reach definitive conclusions regarding differences in clinical outcomes in children with severe acute malnutrition who were given home-based ready-to-use therapeutic food (RUTF) compared to the standard diet, or who were treated with RUTF in different daily amounts or formulations. For this reason, either RUTF or flour porridge can be used to treat children at home depending on availability, affordability and practicality. Well-designed, adequately powered pragmatic randomised controlled trials of HIV-uninfected and HIV-infected children with severe acute malnutrition are needed.US: http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD009000.pub2/abstractRecord #46 of 271ID: CD011779AU: Wolfenden LukeAU: Jones JannahAU: Williams Christopher MAU: Finch MeghanAU: Wyse Rebecca JAU: Kingsland MelanieAU: Tzelepis FloraAU: Wiggers JohnAU: Williams Amanda JAU: Seward KirstyAU: Small TamekaAU: Welch VivianAU: Booth DebbieAU: Yoong Sze LinTI: Strategies to improve the implementation of healthy eating, physical activity and obesity prevention policies, practices or programmes within childcare servicesSO: Cochrane Database of Systematic ReviewsYR: 2016NO: 10PB: John Wiley & Sons, LtdKY: Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice;Motor Activity;Program Development;Child Care [methods] [organization & administration];Child Day Care Centers;Diet [standards];Eating;Guidelines as Topic;Health Promotion [methods] [organization & administration];Obesity [prevention & control];Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic;Child[checkword];Humans[checkword]DOI: 10.1002/14651858.CD011779.pub2AB: Background: Despite the existence of effective interventions and best-practice guideline recommendations for childcare services to implement policies, practices and programmes to promote child healthy eating, physical activity and prevent unhealthy weight gain, many services fail to do so.Objectives: The primary aim of the review was to examine the effectiveness of strategies aimed at improving the implementation of policies, practices or programmes by childcare services that promote child healthy eating, physical activity and/or obesity prevention.    The secondary aims of the review were to:1. describe the impact of such strategies on childcare service staff knowledge, skills or attitudes;  2. describe the cost or cost-effectiveness of such strategies;  3. describe any adverse effects of such strategies on childcare services, service staff or children;  4. examine the effect of such strategies on child diet, physical activity or weight status.Search methods: We searched the following electronic databases on 3 August 2015: the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, MEDLINE In Process, EMBASE, PsycINFO, ERIC, CINAHL and SCOPUS. We also searched reference lists of included trials, handsearched two international implementation science journals and searched the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (www.who.int/ictrp/) and ClinicalTrials.gov (www.clinicaltrials.gov).Selection criteria: We included any study (randomised or non-randomised) with a parallel control group that compared any strategy to improve the implementation of a healthy eating, physical activity or obesity prevention policy, practice or programme by staff of centre-based childcare services to no intervention, 'usual' practice or an alternative strategy.Data collection and analysis: The review authors independently screened abstracts and titles, extracted trial data and assessed risk of bias in pairs; we resolved discrepancies via consensus. Heterogeneity across studies precluded pooling of data and undertaking quantitative assessment via meta-analysis. However, we narratively synthesised the trial findings by describing the effect size of the primary outcome measure for policy or practice implementation (or the median of such measures where a single primary outcome was not stated).Main results: We identified 10 trials as eligible and included them in the review. The trials sought to improve the implementation of policies and practices targeting healthy eating (two trials), physical activity (two trials) or both healthy eating and physical activity (six trials). Collectively the implementation strategies tested in the 10 trials included educational materials, educational meetings, audit and feedback, opinion leaders, small incentives or grants, educational outreach visits or academic detailing. A total of 1053 childcare services participated across all trials. Of the 10 trials, eight examined implementation strategies versus a usual practice control and two compared alternative implementation strategies. There was considerable study heterogeneity. We judged all studies as having high risk of bias for at least one domain.It is uncertain whether the strategies tested improved the implementation of policies, practices or programmes that promote child healthy eating, physical activity and/or obesity prevention. No intervention improved the implementation of all policies and practices targeted by the implementation strategies relative to a comparison group. Of the eight trials that compared an implementation strategy to usual practice or a no intervention control, however, seven reported improvements in the implementation of at least one of the targeted policies or practices relative to control. For these trials the effect on the primary implementation outcome was as follows: among the three trials that reported score-based measures of implementation the scores ranged from 1 to 5.1; across four trials reporting the proportion of staff or services implementing a specific policy or practice this ranged from 0% to 9.5%; and in three trials reporting the time (per day or week) staff or services spent implementing a policy or practice this ranged from 4.3 minutes to 7.7 minutes. The review findings also indicate that is it uncertain whether such interventions improve childcare service staff knowledge or attitudes (two trials), child physical activity (two trials), child weight status (two trials) or child diet (one trial). None of the included trials reported on the cost or cost-effectiveness of the intervention. One trial assessed the adverse effects of a physical activity intervention and found no difference in rates of child injury between groups. For all review outcomes, we rated the quality of the evidence as very low. The primary limitation of the review was the lack of conventional terminology in implementation science, which may have resulted in potentially relevant studies failing to be identified based on the search terms used in this review.Authors' conclusions: Current research provides weak and inconsistent evidence of the effectiveness of such strategies in improving the implementation of policies and practices, childcare service staff knowledge or attitudes, or child diet, physical activity or weight status. Further research in the field is required.US: http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD011779.pub2/abstractRecord #47 of 271ID: CD005051AU: Kelly Sarah AMAU: Summerbell Carolyn DAU: Brynes AudreyAU: Whittaker VictoriaAU: Frost GaryTI: Wholegrain cereals for coronary heart diseaseSO: Cochrane Database of Systematic ReviewsYR: 2007NO: 2PB: John Wiley & Sons, LtdKY: Edible Grain;Cholesterol [blood];Cholesterol, LDL [blood];Coronary Disease [blood] [diet therapy];Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic;Risk Factors;Humans[checkword]CC: VASCDOI: 10.1002/14651858.CD005051.pub2AB: Background: There is increasing evidence from observational studies that wholegrains can have a beneficial effect on risk factors for coronary heart disease (CHD).Objectives: The primary objective is to review the current evidence from randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that assess the relationship between the consumption of wholegrain foods and the effects on CHD mortality, morbidity and on risk factors for CHD, in participants previously diagnosed with CHD or with existing risk factors for CHD.Search methods: We searched CENTRAL (Issue 4, 2005), MEDLINE (1966 to 2005), EMBASE (1980 to 2005), CINAHL (1982 to 2005), ProQuest Digital Dissertations (2004 to 2005). No language restrictions were applied.Selection criteria: We selected randomised controlled trials that assessed the effects of wholegrain foods or diets containing wholegrains, over a minimum of 4 weeks, on CHD and risk factors. Participants included were adults with existing CHD or who had at least one risk factor for CHD, such as abnormal lipids, raised blood pressure or being overweight.Data collection and analysis: Two of our research team independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. Authors of the included studies were contacted for additional information where this was appropriate.Main results: Ten trials met the inclusion criteria. None of the studies found reported the effect of wholegrain diets on CHD mortality or CHD events or morbidity. All 10 included studies reported the effect of wholegrain foods or diets on risk factors for CHD. Studies ranged in duration from 4 to 8 weeks. In eight of the included studies, the wholegrain component was oats. Seven of the eight studies reported lower total and low density lipoproteins (LDL) cholesterol with oatmeal foods than control foods. When the studies were combined in a meta-analysis lower total cholesterol (-0.20 mmol/L, 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.31 to -0.10, P = 0.0001 ) and LDL cholesterol (0.18 mmol/L, 95% CI -0.28 to -0.09, P < 0.0001) were found with oatmeal foods. However, there is a lack of studies on other wholegrains or wholegrain diets.Authors' conclusions: Despite the consistency of effects seen in trials of wholegrain oats, the positive findings should be interpreted cautiously. Many of the trials identified were short term, of poor quality and had insufficient power. Most of the trials were funded by companies with commercial interests in wholegrains. There is a need for well-designed, adequately powered, longer term randomised controlled studies in this area. In particular there is a need for randomised controlled trials on wholegrain foods and diets other than oats.US: http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD005051.pub2/abstractRecord #48 of 271ID: CD008488AU: Wei IgorAU: Pappas YannisAU: Car JosipAU: Sheikh AzizAU: Majeed AzeemTI: Computer-assisted versus oral-and-written dietary history taking for diabetes mellitusSO: Cochrane Database of Systematic ReviewsYR: 2011NO: 12PB: John Wiley & Sons, LtdKY: Diabetes Mellitus [blood] [therapy];Diet Records;Medical Records Systems, Computerized;Hemoglobin A, Glycosylated [analysis];Medical History Taking [methods];Humans[checkword]CC: ENDOCDOI: 10.1002/14651858.CD008488.pub2AB: Background: Diabetes is a chronic illness characterised by insulin resistance or deficiency, resulting in elevated glycosylated haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) levels. Diet and adherence to dietary advice is associated with lower HbA1c levels and control of disease. Dietary history may be an effective clinical tool for diabetes management and has traditionally been taken by oral-and-written methods, although it can also be collected using computer-assisted history taking systems (CAHTS). Although CAHTS were first described in the 1960s, there remains uncertainty about the impact of these methods on dietary history collection, clinical care and patient outcomes such as quality of life. Objectives: To assess the effects of computer-assisted versus oral-and-written dietary history taking on patient outcomes for diabetes mellitus.Search methods: We searched The Cochrane Library (issue 6, 2011), MEDLINE (January 1985 to June 2011), EMBASE (January 1980 to June 2011) and CINAHL (January 1981 to June 2011). Reference lists of obtained articles were also pursued further and no limits were imposed on languages and publication status.Selection criteria: Randomised controlled trials of computer-assisted versus oral-and-written history taking in patients with diabetes mellitus.Data collection and analysis: Two authors independently scanned the title and abstract of retrieved articles. Potentially relevant articles were investigated as full text. Studies that met the inclusion criteria were abstracted for relevant population and intervention characteristics with any disagreements resolved by discussion, or by a third party. Risk of bias was similarly assessed independently.Main results: Of the 2991 studies retrieved, only one study with 38 study participants compared the two methods of history taking over a total of eight weeks. The authors found that as patients became increasingly familiar with using CAHTS, the correlation between patients' food records and computer assessments improved. Reported fat intake decreased in the control group and increased when queried by the computer. The effect of the intervention on the management of diabetes mellitus and blood glucose levels was not reported. Risk of bias was considered moderate for this study.Authors' conclusions: Based on one small study judged to be of moderate risk of bias, we tentatively conclude that CAHTS may be well received by study participants and potentially offer time saving in practice. However, more robust studies with larger sample sizes are needed to confirm these. We cannot draw on any conclusions in relation to any other clinical outcomes at this stage.US: http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD008488.pub2/abstractRecord #49 of 271ID: CD003505AU: Imamura MariAU: Williams KateAU: Wells MandyAU: McGrother CatherineTI: Lifestyle interventions for the treatment of urinary incontinence in adultsSO: Cochrane Database of Systematic ReviewsYR: 2015NO: 12PB: John Wiley & Sons, LtdKY: Beverages;Life Style;Soy Foods;Weight Reduction Programs;Caffeine [administration & dosage];Central Nervous System Stimulants [administration & dosage];Constipation [complications];Quality of Life;Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic;Urinary Incontinence [diet therapy] [rehabilitation];Adult[checkword];Female[checkword];Humans[checkword];Male[checkword]CC: INCONTDOI: 10.1002/14651858.CD003505.pub5AB: Background: Low cost, non-invasive alterations in lifestyle are frequently recommended by healthcare professionals or those presenting with incontinence. However, such recommendations are rarely based on good evidence.Objectives: The objective of the review was to determine the effectiveness of specific lifestyle interventions (i.e. weight loss; dietary changes; fluid intake; reduction in caffeinated, carbonated and alcoholic drinks; avoidance of constipation; stopping smoking; and physical activity) in the management of adult urinary incontinence.Search methods: We searched the Cochrane Incontinence Group Specialised Register, which contains trials identified from the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE and MEDLINE in process, and handsearching of journals and conference proceedings (searched 3 July 2013), and the reference lists of relevant articles. We incorporated the results of these searches fully in the review. We undertook an updated search of the Specialised Register, which now includes searches of ClinicalTrials.gov and WHO ICTRP, on 27 October 2014; potentially eligible studies from this search are currently awaiting classification.Selection criteria: Randomised and quasi-randomised studies of community-based lifestyle interventions compared with no treatment, other conservative therapies, or pharmacological interventions for the treatment of urinary incontinence in adults.Data collection and analysis: Two authors independently assessed study quality and extracted data. We collected information on adverse effects from the trials. Data were combined in a meta-analysis when appropriate. We assessed the quality of the evidence using the GRADE approach.Main results: We included 11 trials in the review, involving a total of 5974 participants.Four trials involving 4701 women compared weight loss programmes with a control intervention. Low quality evidence from one trial suggested that more women following weight loss programmes reported improvement in symptoms of incontinence at six months (163/214 (76%) versus 49/90 (54%), risk ratio (RR) 1.40, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.14 to 1.71), and this effect was sustained at 18 months (N = 291, 75% versus 62%, RR not estimable, reported P value 0.02). No data were available for self-reported cure and quality of life. One of the weight loss trials involving 1296 women reported very low quality evidence for a reduction in weekly urinary incontinence a mean of 2.8 years after following a lifestyle weight loss intervention that had been compared with a pharmacological weight loss intervention.Three trials involving 181 women and 11 men compared change in fluid intake with no change. Limited, very low quality evidence suggested that symptom-specific quality of life scores improved when fluid intake was reduced, although some people reported headaches, constipation or thirst. A further three trials involving 160 women and nine men compared reduction in caffeinated drinks with no change, and one trial involving 42 women compared a soy-rich diet with soy-free diet. However, it was not possible to reach any conclusions about the effects of these changes, due to methodological limitations, that resulted in very low quality evidence.Adverse effects appeared relatively uncommon for all interventions studied.All included studies had a high or unclear risk of bias across all bias parameters, but most notably for allocation concealment. The main factors for our downgrading of the evidence were risk of bias, indirect evidence (less than 12 months of follow-up; and not all participants having confirmed urinary incontinence at baseline in some studies), and imprecise results with wide confidence intervals.Other interventions such as reduction in consumption of sweetened fizzy or diet drinks; reduction in alcohol consumption; avoiding constipation; smoking cessation; restricting strenuous physical forces; or reducing high levels of, or increasing low levels of, physical activity, could not be assessed in this review, as no evidence from randomized controlled trials or quasi-randomised trials was available.Authors' conclusions: Evidence for the effect of weight loss on urinary incontinence is building and should be a research priority. Generally, there was insufficient evidence to inform practice reliably about whether lifestyle interventions are helpful in the treatment of urinary incontinence.US: http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD003505.pub5/abstractRecord #50 of 271ID: CD009710AU: Peckham Emily JAU: Nelson E AndreaAU: Greenhalgh JoanneAU: Cooper KatyAU: Roberts E RachelAU: Agrawal AnuragTI: Homeopathy for treatment of irritable bowel syndromeSO: Cochrane Database of Systematic ReviewsYR: 2013NO: 11PB: John Wiley & Sons, LtdKY: Ferula;Constipation [therapy];Dicyclomine [therapeutic use];Dietary Fiber [therapeutic use];Homeopathy [methods];Irritable Bowel Syndrome [therapy];Phytotherapy [methods];Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic;Adult[checkword];Female[checkword];Humans[checkword];Male[checkword]CC: IBDDOI: 10.1002/14651858.CD009710.pub2AB: Background: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a common, chronic disorder that leads to decreased health-related quality of life and work productivity. Evidence-based treatment guidelines have not been able to give guidance on the effects of homeopathic treatment for IBS because no systematic reviews have been carried out to assess the effectiveness of homeopathic treatment for IBS. Two types of homeopathic treatment were evaluated in this systematic review. In clinical homeopathy a specific remedy is prescribed for a specific condition. This differs from individualised homeopathic treatment, where a homeopathic remedy based on a person's individual symptoms is prescribed after a detailed consultation.Objectives: To assess the effectiveness and safety of homeopathic treatment for treating IBS.Search methods: We searched MEDLINE, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, EMBASE, the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), the Allied and Complementary Medicine Database (AMED), Cochrane IBD/FBD Group Specialised Register, Cochrane Complementary Medicine Field Specialised Register and the database of the Homeopathic Library (Hom-inform) from inception to February 2013.Selection criteria: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs), cohort and case-control studies that compared homeopathic treatment with placebo, other control treatments, or usual care, in adults with IBS were considered for inclusion.Data collection and analysis: Two authors independently assessed the risk of bias and extracted data. The primary outcome was global improvement in IBS. The overall quality of the evidence supporting this outcome was assessed using the GRADE criteria. We calculated the mean difference (MD) and 95% confidence interval (CI) for continuous outcomes and the risk ratio (RR) and 95% CI for dichotomous outcomes.Main results: Three RCTs (213 participants) were included. No cohort or case-control studies were identified. Two studies published in 1976 and 1979 compared clinical homeopathy (homeopathic remedy) to placebo for constipation-predominant IBS. One study published in 1990 compared individualised homeopathic treatment (consultation plus remedy) to usual care (defined as high doses of dicyclomine hydrochloride, faecal bulking agents and diet sheets asking the patient to take a high fibre diet) for the treatment of IBS in female patients. Due to the low quality of reporting in the included studies the risk of bias in all three studies was unclear on most criteria and high for some criteria. A meta-analysis of two small studies (129 participants with constipation-predominant IBS) found a statistically significant difference in global improvement between the homeopathic remedy asafoetida and placebo at a short-term follow-up of two weeks. Seventy-three per cent of patients in the homeopathy group improved compared to 45% of placebo patients (RR 1.61, 95% CI 1.18 to 2.18). There was no statistically significant difference in global improvement between the homeopathic remedies asafoetida plus nux vomica and placebo. Sixty-eight per cent of patients in the homeopathy group improved compared to 52% of placebo patients (1 study, N = 42, RR 1.31, 95% CI 0.80 to 2.15). GRADE analyses rated the overall quality of the evidence for the outcome global improvement as very low due to high or unknown risk of bias, short-term follow-up and sparse data. There was no statistically significant difference found between individualised homeopathic treatment and usual care (1 RCT, N = 20) for the outcome "feeling unwell", where the participant scored how "unwell" they felt before, and after treatment (MD 0.03; 95% CI -3.16 to 3.22). None of the included studies reported on adverse events.Authors' conclusions: A pooled analysis of two small studies suggests a possible benefit for clinical homeopathy, using the remedy asafoetida, over placebo for people with constipation-predominant IBS. These results should be interpreted with caution due to the low quality of reporting in these trials, high or unknown risk of bias, short-term follow-up, and sparse data. One small study found no statistically difference between individualised homeopathy and usual care (defined as high doses of dicyclomine hydrochloride, faecal bulking agents and diet sheets advising a high fibre diet). No conclusions can be drawn from this study due to the low number of participants and the high risk of bias in this trial. In addition, it is likely that usual care has changed since this trial was conducted. Further high quality, adequately powered RCTs are required to assess the efficacy and safety of clinical and individualised homeopathy compared to placebo or usual care.US: http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD009710.pub2/abstractRecord #51 of 271ID: CD003619AU: Peng LijunAU: Wang JiyaoAU: Li FengTI: Weight reduction for non-alcoholic fatty liver diseaseSO: Cochrane Database of Systematic ReviewsYR: 2011NO: 6PB: John Wiley & Sons, LtdKY: Anti-Obesity Agents [therapeutic use];Body Mass Index;Diet, Reducing;Exercise;Fatty Liver [therapy];Lactones [therapeutic use];Life Style;Non-alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease;Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic;Weight Loss [physiology];Humans[checkword]CC: LIVERDOI: 10.1002/14651858.CD003619.pub3AB: Background: Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is becoming a wide spread liver disease. The present recommendations for treatment are not evidence-based. Some of them are various weight reduction measures with diet, exercise, drug, or surgical therapy.Objectives: To assess the benefits and harms of intended weight reduction for patients with NAFLD.Search methods: We searched The Cochrane Hepato-Biliary Group Controlled Trials Register, The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) in The Cochrane Library, PubMed, EMBASE, Science Citation Index Expanded, Chinese Biomedicine Database, and ClinicalTrials.gov until February 2011.Selection criteria: We included randomised clinical trials evaluating weight reduction with different measures versus no intervention or placebo in NAFLD patients.Data collection and analysis: We extracted data independently. We calculated the odds ratio (OR) for dichotomous data and calculated the mean difference (MD) for continuous data, both with 95% confidence intervals (CI).Main results: The review includes seven trials; five on aspects of lifestyle changes (eg, diet, physical exercise) and two on treatment with a weight reduction drug 'orlistat'. In total, 373 participants were enrolled, and the duration of the trials ranged from 1 month to 1 year. Only one trial on lifestyle programme was judged to be of low risk of bias. We could not perform meta-analyses for the main outcomes as they were either not reported or there were insufficient number of trials for each outcome to be meta-analysed. We could meta-analyse the available data for body weight and body mass index only. Adverse events were poorly reported.Authors' conclusions: The sparse data and high risk of bias preclude us from drawing any definite conclusion on lifestyle programme or orlistat for treatment of NAFLD. Further randomised clinical trials with low risk of bias are needed to test the beneficial and harmful effects of weight reduction for NAFLD patients. The long-term prognosis of development of fibrosis, mortality, and quality of life should be studied.US: http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD003619.pub3/abstractRecord #52 of 271ID: CD004192AU: Farinotti MariangelaAU: Vacchi LauraAU: Simi SilvanaAU: Di Pietrantonj CarloAU: Brait LorenzoAU: Filippini GraziellaTI: Dietary interventions for multiple sclerosisSO: Cochrane Database of Systematic ReviewsYR: 2012NO: 12PB: John Wiley & Sons, LtdKY: Dietary Supplements;Fatty Acids, Omega-3 [administration & dosage];Fatty Acids, Omega-6 [administration & dosage];Fatty Acids, Unsaturated [administration & dosage];Multiple Sclerosis [diet therapy];Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic;Humans[checkword]DOI: 10.1002/14651858.CD004192.pub3AB: Background: Clinical and experimental data suggest that certain dietary regimens, particularly those including polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) and vitamins, might improve outcomes in people with multiple sclerosis (MS). Diets and dietary supplements are much used by people with MS in the belief that they might improve disease outcomes and overcome the effectiveness limits of conventional treatments.This is an update of the Cochrane review "Dietary intervention for multiple sclerosis" (first published on The Cochrane Library 2007, Issue 1).Objectives: To answer MS patients' questions regarding the efficacy and safety of dietary regimens for MS. Can changes in dietary habits be an effective intervention for MS patients? Are the potential side effects of these interventions known, and have they been measured? Are potential interactions between dietary interventions and other curative or symptomatic treatments known and have they been studied?Search methods: We searched the Cochrane Multiple Sclerosis and Rare Diseases of the Central Nervous System Group Specialised Register (November 2011), CENTRAL (The Cochrane Library 2011, Issue 4), MEDLINE (PubMed) (1966 to November 2011), EMBASE (embase.com) (1974 to November 2011) and reference lists of papers found.Selection criteria: All controlled trials (randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and controlled clinical trials (CCTs)) on a specific dietary intervention, diet plan or dietary supplementation, except for vitamin D supplementation, compared to no dietary modification or placebo were eligible.Data collection and analysis: Two review authors independently selected articles, assessed trial quality and extracted data. Data were entered and analysed in RevMan.Dichotomous data were summarised as relative risks (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) using a random-effects model in the presence of heterogeneity (I² > 60%). Continuous data were analysed using weighted mean differences, determined by the difference between the pre- and post-intervention changes in the treatment and control groups.Main results: Six RCTs that investigated PUFAs emerged from the search strategy, accounting for 794 randomised patients.PUFAs did not have a significant effect on disease progression at 24 months. Omega-6 fatty acids (11 to 23 g/day linoleic acid) didn't show any benefit in 144 MS patients (RR 1.04, 95% CI 0.66 to 1.63). Linoleic acid (2.9 to 3.4 g/day) had no benefit in 65 chronic progressive MS patients (RR 0.78, 95% CI 0.43 to 1.42). Omega-3 fatty acids had no benefit in 292 relapsing remitting MS patients (RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.65 to 1.03, P = 0.08).Slight potential benefits in relapse outcomes were associated with omega-6 fatty acids in some studies, however these findings were limited by the reduced validity of the endpoints. No judgements about safety or patient-reported outcomes were possible. In general, trial quality was poor.No studies on vitamin supplementation and allergen-free diets were analysed as none met the eligibility criteria, mainly due to lack of clinical outcomes.Authors' conclusions: PUFAs seem to have no major effect on the main clinical outcome in MS (disease progression), but they may tend to reduce the frequency of relapses over two years. However, the data that are available are insufficient to assess a real benefit or harm from PUFA supplementation because of their uncertain quality.Evidence on the possible benefits and risks of vitamin supplementation and antioxidant supplements in MS is lacking. More research is required to assess the effectiveness of dietary interventions in MS.US: http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD004192.pub3/abstractRecord #53 of 271ID: CD008005AU: Somaraju Usha RaniAU: Merrin MarcusTI: Sapropterin dihydrochloride for phenylketonuriaSO: Cochrane Database of Systematic ReviewsYR: 2015NO: 3PB: John Wiley & Sons, LtdKY: Biopterin [administration & dosage] [adverse effects] [analogs & derivatives];Phenylalanine [blood];Phenylketonurias [blood] [drug therapy];Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic;Adult[checkword];Child[checkword];Child, Preschool[checkword];Humans[checkword]CC: CFDOI: 10.1002/14651858.CD008005.pub4AB: Background: Phenylketonuria results from a deficiency of the enzyme phenylalanine hydroxylase. Dietary restriction of phenylalanine keeps blood phenylalanine concentration low. Most natural foods are excluded from diet and supplements are used to supply other nutrients. Recent publications report a decrease in blood phenylalanine concentration in some patients treated with sapropterin dihydrochloride. We examined the evidence for the use of sapropterin dihydrochloride to treat phenylketonuria. This is an update of a previously published Cochrane Review. Objectives: To assess the safety and efficacy of sapropterin dihydrochloride in lowering blood phenylalanine concentration in people with phenylketonuria.Search methods: We identified relevant trials from the Group's Inborn Errors of Metabolism Trials Register. Date of last search: 11 August 2014.We also searched ClinicalTrials.gov and Current controlled trials. Last search: 4 September 2014We contacted the manufacturers of the drug (BioMarin Pharmaceutical Inc.) for information regarding any unpublished trials.Selection criteria: Randomized controlled trials comparing sapropterin with no supplementation or placebo in people with phenylketonuria due to phenylalanine hydroxylase deficiency.Data collection and analysis: Two authors independently assessed trials and extracted outcome data.Main results: Two placebo-controlled trials were included. One trial administered 10 mg/kg/day sapropterin in 89 children and adults with phenylketonuria whose diets were not restricted and who had previously responded to saproterin.This trial measured change in blood phenylalanine concentration. The second trial screened 90 children (4 to 12 years) with phenylketonuria whose diet was restricted, for responsiveness to sapropterin. Forty-six responders entered the placebo-controlled part of the trial and received 20 mg/kg/day sapropterin. This trial measured change in both phenylalanine concentration and protein tolerance. Both trials reported adverse events. The trials showed an overall low risk of bias; but both are Biomarin-sponsored. One trial showed a significant lowering in blood phenylalanine concentration in the sapropterin group (10 mg/kg/day), mean difference -238.80 μmol/L (95% confidence interval -343.09 to -134.51); a second trial (20 mg/kg/day sapropterin) showed a non-significant difference, mean difference -51.90 μmol/L (95% confidence interval -197.27 to 93.47). The second trial also reported a significant increase in phenylalanine tolerance, mean difference18.00 mg/kg/day (95% confidence interval 12.28 to 23.72) in the 20 mg/kg/day sapropterin group.Authors' conclusions: There is evidence of short-term benefit from using sapropterin in some people with sapropterin-responsive forms of phenylketonuria; blood phenylalanine concentration is lowered and protein tolerance increased. There are no serious adverse events associated with using sapropterin in the short term.There is no evidence on the long-term effects of sapropterin and no clear evidence of effectiveness in severe phenylketonuria.US: http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD008005.pub4/abstractRecord #54 of 271ID: CD009339AU: Adeniyi Folasade BAU: Young TarynTI: Weight loss interventions for chronic asthmaSO: Cochrane Database of Systematic ReviewsYR: 2012NO: 7PB: John Wiley & Sons, LtdKY: Caloric Restriction;Exercise;Weight Loss;Anti-Obesity Agents [therapeutic use];Asthma [complications] [therapy];Chronic Disease;Obesity [complications] [therapy];Overweight [complications] [therapy];Adolescent[checkword];Adult[checkword];Aged[checkword];Humans[checkword];Middle Aged[checkword];Young Adult[checkword]CC: AIRWAYSDOI: 10.1002/14651858.CD009339.pub2AB: Background: Asthma and obesity are both public health problems with increasing prevalence globally. Several epidemiological studies have shown an association between asthma and obesity, however there is no good quality evidence on the effect of weight loss on asthma control.Objectives: To assess the effect of various interventions for weight loss on measures of asthma control and weight loss amongst overweight or obese patients with chronic asthma.Search methods: We searched the Cochrane Airways Group's Specialized Register of Trials (CAGR) (derived from systematic searches of bibliographic databases, including the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library), MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, AMED and PsycINFO, and handsearching of respiratory journals and meeting abstracts). We also searched ongoing trials web sites and dissertation databases up to March 2012. We contacted experts in the field and searched reference lists for additional studies.Selection criteria: We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of weight loss interventions for overweight or obese participants with asthma compared to either no intervention for weight loss or an alternative weight loss intervention.Data collection and analysis: Two authors independently assessed study eligibility and risk of bias, and extracted data using a data extraction form. We did not undertake any meta-analysis as there were no suitable data to combine.Main results: We included four completed studies conducted amongst adults (n = 197). Two were published as abstracts, and two as full articles. Interventions included supervised physical activity, low calorie diet and anti-obesity drugs (singly or in combination), and were compared to usual care (two studies), low calorie diet (one study), while one study had three intervention arms (physical activity versus low calorie diet versus a combination of the two). Two studies were conducted in high-income countries, while two were conducted in upper, middle-income countries.All studies had an unclear risk of selection and a high risk of detection bias. One of the studies found a statistically significant reduction in symptoms scores in treatment compared to control groups: the difference between groups in total St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) score was −10 units (95% CI -18 to−1; P = 0.02). One study showed reduction in doses of rescue medication in treatment compared with control groups in the short term. Weight loss was associated with some improvement in forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) and forced vital capacity (FVC) in one study, which was statistically significant, but clinically unimportant; there was no improvement in peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR). No data were reported on health care utilization and adverse effects. One study reported statistically significant weight loss in the treatment group compared to controls with no intervention, which was still significant at one year follow-up.Authors' conclusions: Implications for practice  This review found one randomized trial that showed that weight loss may be beneficial for improving asthma control in overweight and obese patients, in conjunction with weight loss in intervention groups in the short term. Applying the GRADE system to the results of this review however, shows that the quality of evidence is low, because although all four studies are RCTs there were serious methodological limitations in the studies (unclear risk of selection bias and high risk of detection bias) and imprecision (small sample size). There is inadequate evidence to comment on the effect of weight loss interventions on quality of life and health care utilization. In addition, there was inadequate reporting of data on adverse effects to permit proper balancing of harms and benefits of the interventions. On account of this low quality of evidence, the benefit of weight loss as an intervention for asthma control remains uncertain, and as such, clinicians should be prepared to help patients to make a decision that is consistent with their own values.Implications for research  The finding that most of the included studies were of low methodological quality highlights the need for further well designed RCTs, with emphasis on adequate methods of allocation sequence generation as well as allocation concealment and longer follow-up periods. These studies need to report more fully on relevant outcomes (both statistically significant and otherwise) such as: asthma symptoms/control, use of rescue medication, change in lung function parameters (actual mean/median values), hospital utilization, quality of life, and adverse effects. There is also a need for longer intervention as well as follow-up durations to evaluate the effect of sustained measures to achieve weight loss, and to determine if these effects are still significantly present after a considerable period of time.There is also a need for these well designed studies in children and adolescents, as well as in low-income countries such as Africa, where the prepackaged, low energy diets, as well as structured physical activity-based interventions utilized in these included studies, may not be feasible or applicable.US: http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD009339.pub2/abstractRecord #55 of 271ID: CD003430AU: Yao YiboAU: Suo TaoAU: Andersson RolandAU: Cao YongqingAU: Wang ChenAU: Lu JingenAU: Chui EvelyneTI: Dietary fibre for the prevention of recurrent colorectal adenomas and carcinomasSO: Cochrane Database of Systematic ReviewsYR: 2017NO: 1PB: John Wiley & Sons, LtdKY: Adenoma [prevention & control];Colorectal Neoplasms [prevention & control];Dietary Fiber [therapeutic use];Neoplasm Recurrence, Local [prevention & control];Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic;Humans[checkword]DOI: 10.1002/14651858.CD003430.pub2AB: Background: This is an update of the Cochrane review published in 2002.Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in industrialised countries. Experimental evidence has supported the hypothesis that dietary fibre may protect against the development of CRC, although epidemiologic data have been inconclusive.Objectives: To assess the effect of dietary fibre on the recurrence of colorectal adenomatous polyps in people with a known history of adenomatous polyps and on the incidence of CRC compared to placebo. Further, to identify the reported incidence of adverse effects, such as abdominal pain or diarrhoea, that resulted from the fibre intervention.Search methods: We identified randomised controlled trials (RCTs) from Cochrane Colorectal Cancer's Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE and Embase (search date, 4 April 2016). We also searched ClinicalTrials.gov and WHO International Trials Registry Platform on October 2016.Selection criteria: We included RCTs or quasi-RCTs. The population were those having a history of adenomatous polyps, but no previous history of CRC, and repeated visualisation of the colon/rectum after at least two-years' follow-up. Dietary fibre was the intervention. The primary outcomes were the number of participants with: 1. at least one adenoma, 2. more than one adenoma, 3. at least one adenoma greater than or equal to 1 cm, or 4. a new diagnosis of CRC. The secondary outcome was the number of adverse events.Data collection and analysis: Two reviewers independently extracted data, assessed trial quality and resolved discrepancies by consensus. We used risk ratios (RR) and risk difference (RD) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) to measure the effect. If statistical significance was reached, we reported the number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) or harmful outcome (NNTH). We combined the study data using the fixed-effect model if it was clinically, methodologically, and statistically reasonable.Main results: We included seven studies, of which five studies with 4798 participants provided data for analyses in this review. The mean ages of the participants ranged from 56 to 66 years. All participants had a history of adenomas, which had been removed to achieve a polyp-free colon at baseline. The interventions were wheat bran fibre, ispaghula husk, or a comprehensive dietary intervention with high fibre whole food sources alone or in combination. The comparators were low-fibre (2 to 3 g per day), placebo, or a regular diet. The combined data showed no statistically significant difference between the intervention and control groups for the number of participants with at least one adenoma (5 RCTs, n = 3641, RR 1.04, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.13, low-quality evidence), more than one adenoma (2 RCTs, n = 2542, RR 1.06, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.20, low-quality evidence), or at least one adenoma 1 cm or greater (4 RCTs, n = 3224, RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.20, low-quality evidence) at three to four years. The results on the number of participants diagnosed with colorectal cancer favoured the control group over the dietary fibre group (2 RCTS, n = 2794, RR 2.70, 95% CI 1.07 to 6.85, low-quality evidence). After 8 years of comprehensive dietary intervention, no statistically significant difference was found in the number of participants with at least one recurrent adenoma (1 RCT, n = 1905, RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.20), or with more than one adenoma (1 RCT, n = 1905, RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.64 to 1.24). More participants given ispaghula husk group had at least one recurrent adenoma than the control group (1 RCT, n = 376, RR 1.45, 95% CI 1.01 to 2.08). Other analyses by types of fibre intervention were not statistically significant. The overall dropout rate was over 16% in these trials with no reasons given for these losses. Sensitivity analysis incorporating these missing data shows that none of the results can be considered as robust; when the large numbers of participants lost to follow-up were assumed to have had an event or not, the results changed sufficiently to alter the conclusions that we would draw. Therefore, the reliability of the findings may have been compromised by these missing data (attrition bias) and should be interpreted with caution.Authors' conclusions: There is a lack of evidence from existing RCTs to suggest that increased dietary fibre intake will reduce the recurrence of adenomatous polyps in those with a history of adenomatous polyps within a two to eight year period. However, these results may be unreliable and should be interpreted cautiously, not only because of the high rate of loss to follow-up, but also because adenomatous polyp is a surrogate outcome for the unobserved true endpoint CRC. Longer-term trials with higher dietary fibre levels are needed to enable confident conclusion.US: http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD003430.pub2/abstractRecord #56 of 271ID: CD000484AU: Mulrow Cynthia DAU: Chiquette ElaineAU: Angel LAU: Grimm RichardAU: Cornell JohnAU: Summerbell Carolyn DAU: Anagnostelis Betsy BAU: Brand MTI: Dieting to reduce body weight for controlling hypertension in adultsSO: Cochrane Database of Systematic ReviewsYR: 2008NO: 4PB: John Wiley & Sons, LtdKY: Diet, Reducing;Hypertension [diet therapy];Adult[checkword];Humans[checkword]CC: HTNDOI: 10.1002/14651858.CD000484.pub2AB: The authors have requested this review to be withdrawn.

Searches were undertaken from 1985 to May 2008. References were checked. No language restrictions were applied.Selection criteria: We selected randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of lifestyle (i.e. dietary, physical activity and/or behavioural therapy), drug and surgical interventions for treating obesity in children (mean age under 18 years) with or without the support of family members, with a minimum of six months follow up (three months for actual drug therapy). Interventions that specifically dealt with the treatment of eating disorders or type 2 diabetes, or included participants with a secondary or syndromic cause of obesity were excluded.Data collection and analysis: Two reviewers independently assessed trial quality and extracted data following the Cochrane Handbook. Where necessary authors were contacted for additional information.Main results: We included 64 RCTs (5230 participants). Lifestyle interventions focused on physical activity and sedentary behaviour in 12 studies, diet in 6 studies, and 36 concentrated on behaviorally orientated treatment programs. Three types of drug interventions (metformin, orlistat and sibutramine) were found in 10 studies. No surgical intervention was eligible for inclusion. The studies included varied greatly in intervention design, outcome measurements and methodological quality.Meta-analyses indicated a reduction in overweight at 6 and 12 months follow up in: i) lifestyle interventions involving children; and ii) lifestyle interventions in adolescents with or without the addition of orlistat or sibutramine. A range of adverse effects was noted in drug RCTs.Authors' conclusions: While there is limited quality data to recommend one treatment program to be favoured over another, this review shows that combined behavioural lifestyle interventions compared to standard care or self-help can produce a significant and clinically meaningful reduction in overweight in children and adolescents. In obese adolescents, consideration should be given to the use of either orlistat or sibutramine, as an adjunct to lifestyle interventions, although this approach needs to be carefully weighed up against the potential for adverse effects. Furthermore, high quality research that considers psychosocial determinants for behaviour change, strategies to improve clinician-family interaction, and cost-effective programs for primary and community care is required.US: http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD001872.pub2/abstractRecord #59 of 271ID: CD007374AU: Li TingAU: Wu Hong MeiAU: Wang FengAU: Huang Chang QuanAU: Yang MingAU: Dong Bi RongAU: Liu Guan JTI: Education programmes for people with diabetic kidney diseaseSO: Cochrane Database of Systematic ReviewsYR: 2011NO: 6PB: John Wiley & Sons, LtdKY: Diabetic Nephropathies [diagnosis] [therapy];Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice;Patient Education as Topic;Patient Compliance;Program Evaluation;Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic;Self Care [methods];Humans[checkword]CC: RENALDOI: 10.1002/14651858.CD007374.pub2AB: Background: Adherence to complex regimens for patients with diabetic kidney disease (DKD) is often poor. Interventions to enhance adherence require intensive education and behavioural counselling. However, whether the existing evidence is scientifically rigorous and can support recommendations for routine use of educational programmes in DKD is still unknown.Objectives: To evaluate the benefits and harms of education programmes for people with DKD.Search methods: In January 2010 we searched the Cochrane Renal Group's Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE and four Chinese medicine databases (CBM-disc, Chinese Science and Technique Journals Database, China National Infrastructure and WanFang).Selection criteria: All randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs studying the benefits and harms of educational programmes for people with DKD.Data collection and analysis: Two authors independently searched the literature, determined study eligibility, assessed quality, extracted and entered data. We expressed dichotomous outcomes as risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) and continuous data as mean difference (MD) or standardised mean differences (SMD). Data were pooled using the random effects model.Main results: Two studies (207 patients) were eligible. The methodological quality was not high. Compared with no educational programmes, educational programmes for patients with diabetes on dialysis improved patients' knowledge for the following outcomes: diagnosis (SMD 1.14, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.90); monitoring (SMD 1.51, 95% CI 1.0 to 2.01); hypoglycaemia (SMD 1.67, 95% CI 1.16 to 2.17), hyperglycaemia (SMD 0.80, 95% CI 0.35 to 1.25); medication with insulin (SMD 1.21, 95% CI 0.74 to 1.68); oral medication (SMD 0.98, 95% CI 0.52 to1.43); personal health habits (SMD 1.84, 95% CI 1.33 to 2.36); diet (SMD 0.53, 95% CI 0.09 to 0.97); exercise (SMD 1.13, 95% CI 0.67 to 1.60); chronic complications (SMD 1.28, 95% CI 0.80 to1.75) and living with diabetes and coping with stress (SMD 0.71, 95% CI 0.26 to 1.15). For patients with diabetes and microalbuminuria, educational programmes improved general knowledge for the following outcomes: diabetes (SMD 0.84, 95% CI 0.43 to 1.26); patients' total self-efficacy (MD 19.00, 95% CI 12.58 to 25.42) and patients' changes in beliefs on treatment effectiveness (MD 0.25, 95% CI 0.07 to 0.43) at the end of treatment, and general knowledge (MD 14.39, 95% CI 7.45 to 21.33); specific self-efficacy in home blood glucose monitoring (HBGM) (MD 11.28, 95% CI 1.92 to 20.64) and changes of beliefs on personal control (MD 0.31, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.61) at the end of three-months follow-up. For patients with diabetes on dialysis, educational programmes also showed improvement in the following self-management behaviours: checking feet (RR 1.63, 95% CI 1.01 to 2.63); using lotion (RR 9.71, 95% CI 2.45 to 38.56) and wearing appropriate shoes and socks (RR 4.39, 95% CI 1.87 to 10.32). For patients with diabetes and microalbuminuria, educational programmes improved the following behaviours: general diet (MD 0.73, 95% CI 0.10 to 1.36), specific diet (MD 1.02, 95% CI 0.42 to1.62) and HBGM (MD 2.13, 95% CI 1.18 to 3.08) at the end of treatment; and specific diet (MD 0.62, 95% CI 0.18 to 1.06) and HBGM (MD 1.48, 95% CI 0.48 to 2.48) at the end of three-months follow-up. No data were available on changes in kidney function, incidence of cardiovascular events, change of patients' attitude or adverse events.Authors' conclusions: Education programmes appear to have beneficial effects on improving patients' knowledge of diabetes and some self-management behavioural changes for patients with diabetes on dialysis or with microalbuminuria. Educational programmes appear to have beneficial effects on improving patients' self-efficacy and result in some beliefs changes for patients with diabetes and microalbuminuria. However, only two studies with small sample sizes and inadequate quality were included in this review. There is, therefore, inadequate evidence to support the beneficial effects of education programmes for people with DKD.US: http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD007374.pub2/abstractRecord #60 of 271ID: CD006287AU: Chang Brent AAU: Thamboo AndrewAU: Burton Martin JAU: Diamond ChrisAU: Nunez Desmond ATI: Needle aspiration versus incision and drainage for the treatment of peritonsillar abscessSO: Cochrane Database of Systematic ReviewsYR: 2016NO: 12PB: John Wiley & Sons, LtdKY: Needles;Drainage [adverse effects] [methods];Eating;Peritonsillar Abscess [complications] [therapy];Recurrence;Retreatment;Suction [adverse effects] [methods];Symptom Assessment;Time Factors;Adolescent[checkword];Adult[checkword];Child[checkword];Humans[checkword]DOI: 10.1002/14651858.CD006287.pub4AB: Background: Peritonsillar abscess is a common infection presenting as a collection of pus in the peritonsillar area. The condition is characterised by a severe sore throat, difficulty in swallowing and pain on swallowing, fever and malaise, and trismus. Needle aspiration and incision and drainage are the two main treatment modalities currently used in the treatment of this condition. The effectiveness of one versus the other has not been clearly demonstrated and remains an area of debate.Objectives: To assess the effectiveness and risks of needle aspiration versus incision and drainage for the treatment of peritonsillar abscess in older children (eight years of age or older), adolescents and adults.Search methods: The Cochrane ENT Information Specialist searched the ENT Trials Register; Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL 2016, Issue 7); Ovid MEDLINE; Ovid Embase; CINAHL; Web of Science; ClinicalTrials.gov; ICTRP and additional sources for published and unpublished trials. The date of the search was 25 August 2016.Selection criteria: Randomised controlled trials comparing needle aspiration with incision and drainage.Data collection and analysis: We used the standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. Our primary outcomes were recurrence rate (proportion of patients needing repeat intervention) and adverse effects associated with the intervention. Secondary outcomes were time to resumption of normal diet, complications of the disease process and symptom scores. We used GRADE to assess the quality of evidence for each outcome; this is indicated in italics.Main results: We included 11 studies (674 participants). The risk of bias was high or unclear in all of the included studies. All studies compared needle aspiration to incision and drainage.All but one of the 11 studies reported on the primary outcome of recurrence. When we pooled data from the 10 studies the recurrence rate was higher in the needle aspiration group compared with incision and drainage: risk ratio (RR) 3.74 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.63 to 8.59; 612 participants). We detected moderate heterogeneity in this analysis (I2 = 48%). In interpreting the pooled result it is important to note that the evidence for this outcome was of very low quality.None of the other outcomes (adverse effects of the intervention, time to resumption of normal diet, complications of the disease process and symptom scores) were consistently measured across all studies.Only three studies reported on adverse effects/events associated with the intervention and only one such event in a single patient was reported (post-procedure bleeding following incision and drainage: 1/28, 3.6%) (very low-quality evidence). Time to resumption of normal diet was compared in two studies; neither found an obvious difference between needle aspiration and incision and drainage (very low-quality evidence).Only three studies stated that they would report complications of the disease process. In these three studies, the only complication reported was admission to hospital for dehydration in two patients who underwent incision and drainage (2/13, 6.7%). Symptom scores were measured in four studies; three evaluated pain using different scales and one other symptoms. The data could not be pooled in a meta-analysis. Two studies evaluating procedural pain reported this to be lower in the needle aspiration groups. One study found comparable rates of pain resolution at five days post-intervention between groups. The quality of the evidence for symptom scores was very low.Authors' conclusions: Although a number of studies have sought to evaluate whether or not needle aspiration or incision and drainage is more effective in patients with peritonsillar abscess, there is no high-quality evidence to allow a firm conclusion to be drawn and the answer remains uncertain. Very low-quality evidence suggests that incision and drainage may be associated with a lower chance of recurrence than needle aspiration. There is some very low-quality evidence to suggest that needle aspiration is less painful.US: http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD006287.pub4/abstractRecord #61 of 271ID: CD000080AU: Kramer Michael STI: Energy/protein restriction for high weight-for-height or weight gain during pregnancySO: Cochrane Database of Systematic ReviewsYR: 1996NO: 4PB: John Wiley & Sons, LtdKY: Diet;Weight Gain;Diet, Protein-Restricted;Diet, Reducing;Energy Intake;Obesity [prevention & control];Pregnancy Complications [prevention & control];Female[checkword];Humans[checkword];Pregnancy[checkword]CC: PREGDOI: 10.1002/14651858.CD000080AB: The 'Energy/protein restriction for high weight-for-height or weight gain during pregnancy' Review (last published in Issue 3, 2003 of The Cochrane Library) has been withdrawn because it has been included in the updated Review 'Energy and protein intake in pregnancy', first published in Issue 4, 2003 of The Cochrane Library.This combination was suggested by colleagues in the field, by the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's (CPCG) editors, and by the CPCG's Consumer Panel.US: http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD000080/abstractRecord #62 of 271ID: CD008788AU: Wang ZhenAU: Chen JunqiangAU: Su KaAU: Dong ZhiyongTI: Abdominal drainage versus no drainage post-gastrectomy for gastric cancerSO: Cochrane Database of Systematic ReviewsYR: 2015NO: 5PB: John Wiley & Sons, LtdKY: Drainage [adverse effects] [mortality];Gastrectomy [mortality];Length of Stay;Operative Time;Postoperative Complications [prevention & control];Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic;Reoperation [statistics & numerical data];Stomach Neoplasms [mortality] [surgery];Time Factors;Humans[checkword]CC: UPPERGIDOI: 10.1002/14651858.CD008788.pub3AB: Background: Gastrectomy remains the primary therapeutic method for resectable gastric cancer. Thought of as an important measure to reduce post-operative complications and mortality, abdominal drainage has been used widely after gastrectomy for gastric cancer in previous decades. The benefits of abdominal drainage have been questioned by researchers in recent years.Objectives: The objectives of this review were to assess the benefits and harms of routine abdominal drainage post-gastrectomy for gastric cancer.Search methods: We searched the Cochrane Upper Gastrointestinal and Pancreatic Diseases (UGPD) Group Specialised Register and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) in The Cochrane Library (2014, Issue 11); MEDLINE (via PubMed) (1950 to November 2014); EMBASE (1980 to November 2014); and the Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) Database (1979 to November 2014).Selection criteria: We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing an abdominal drain versus no drain in patients who had undergone gastrectomy (not considering the scale of gastrectomy and the extent of lymphadenectomy); irrespective of language, publication status, and the type of drain. We excluded RCTs comparing one drain with another.Data collection and analysis: We adhered to the standard methodological procedures of The Cochrane Collaboration. From each included trial, we extracted the data on the methodological quality and characteristics of the participants, mortality (30-day mortality), re-operations, post-operative complications (pneumonia, wound infection, intra-abdominal abscess, anastomotic leak, drain-related complications), operation time, length of post-operative hospital stay, and initiation of a soft diet. For dichotomous data, we calculated the risk ratio (RR) and 95% confidence interval (CI). For continuous data, we calculated mean difference (MD) and 95% CI. We tested heterogeneity using the Chi2 test. We used a fixed-effect model for data analysis with RevMan software, but we used a random-effects model if the P value of the Chi2 test was less than 0.1.Main results: We included four RCTs involving 438 patients (220 patients in the drain group and 218 in the no-drain group). There was no evidence of a difference between the two groups in mortality (RR 1.73, 95% CI 0.38 to 7.84); re-operations (RR 2.49, 95% CI 0.71 to 8.74); post-operative complications (pneumonia: RR 1.18, 95% CI 0.55 to 2.54; wound infection: RR 1.23, 95% CI 0.47 to 3.23; intra-abdominal abscess: RR 1.27, 95% CI 0.29 to 5.51; anastomotic leak: RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.06 to 14.47); or initiation of soft diet (MD 0.15 days, 95% CI -0.07 to 0.37). However, the addition of a drain prolonged the operation time (MD 9.07 min, 95% CI 2.56 to 15.57) and post-operative hospital stay (MD 0.69 day, 95% CI 0.18 to 1.21) and led to drain-related complications. Additionally, we should note that 30-day mortality and re-operations are very rare events and, as a result, very large numbers of patients would be required to make any sensible conclusions about whether the two groups were similar. The overall quality of the evidence according to the GRADE approach was 'very low' for mortality and re-operations, and 'low' for post-operative complications, operation time, and post-operative length of stay.Authors' conclusions: We found no convincing evidence to support routine drain use after gastrectomy for gastric cancer.US: http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD008788.pub3/abstractRecord #63 of 271ID: CD004095AU: Norris Susan LAU: Zhang XuanpingAU: Avenell AlisonAU: Gregg EdwardAU: Brown TamaraAU: Schmid Christopher HAU: Lau JosephTI: Long-term non-pharmacological weight loss interventions for adults with type 2 diabetes mellitusSO: Cochrane Database of Systematic ReviewsYR: 2005NO: 2PB: John Wiley & Sons, LtdKY: Weight Loss;Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2 [complications];Exercise;Obesity [etiology] [mortality] [therapy];Quality of Life;Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic;Adult[checkword];Humans[checkword]CC: ENDOCDOI: 10.1002/14651858.CD004095.pub2AB: Background: Most persons with type 2 diabetes are overweight and obesity worsens the metabolic and physiologic abnormalities associated with diabetes.Objectives: The objective of this review is to assess the effectiveness of lifestyle and behavioral weight loss and weight control interventions for adults with type 2 diabetes.Search methods: Studies were obtained from computerized searches of multiple electronic bibliographic databases, supplemented with hand searches of selected journals and consultation with experts in obesity research.Selection criteria: Studies were included if they were published or unpublished randomized controlled trials in any language, and examined weight loss or weight control strategies using one or more dietary, physical activity, or behavioral interventions, with a follow-up interval of at least 12 months.Data collection and analysis: Effects were combined using a random effects model.Main results: The 22 studies of weight loss interventions identified had a 4,659 participants and follow-up of 1 to 5 years. The pooled weight loss for any intervention in comparison to usual care among 585 subjects was 1.7 kg (95 % confidence interval [CI] 0.3 to 3.2), or 3.1% of baseline body weight among 517 subjects. Other main comparisons demonstrated non significant results: among 126 persons receiving a physical activity and behavioral intervention, those who also received a very low calorie diet lost 3.0 kg (95% CI -0.5 to 6.4), or 1.6% of baseline body weight, more than persons receiving a low-calorie diet. Among 53 persons receiving identical dietary and behavioral interventions, those receiving more intense physical activity interventions lost 3.9 kg (95% CI -1.9 to 9.7), or 3.6% of baseline body weight, more than those receiving a less intense or no physical activity intervention. Comparison groups often achieved significant weight loss (up to 10.0 kg), minimizing between-group differences. Changes in glycated hemoglobin generally corresponded to changes in weight and were not significant when between-group differences were examined. No data were identified on quality of life and mortality.Authors' conclusions: Weight loss strategies using dietary, physical activity, or behavioral interventions produced small between-group improvements in weight. These results were minimized by weight loss in the comparison group, however, and examination of individual study arms revealed that multicomponent interventions including very low calorie diets or low calorie diets may hold promise for achieving weight loss in adults with type 2 diabetes.US: http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD004095.pub2/abstractRecord #64 of 271ID: CD012008AU: Loveman EmmaAU: Al-Khudairy LenaAU: Johnson Rebecca EAU: Robertson WendyAU: Colquitt Jill LAU: Mead Emma LAU: Ells Louisa JAU: Metzendorf Maria-IntiAU: Rees KarenTI: Parent-only interventions for childhood overweight or obesity in children aged 5 to 11 yearsSO: Cochrane Database of Systematic ReviewsYR: 2015NO: 12PB: John Wiley & Sons, LtdKY: Body Mass Index;Body Weight;Health Status;Overweight [therapy];Parents [education];Pediatric Obesity [therapy];Quality of Life;Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic;Self Concept;Child[checkword];Child, Preschool[checkword];Humans[checkword]DOI: 10.1002/14651858.CD012008AB: Background: Child and adolescent overweight and obesity have increased globally, and are associated with short- and long-term health consequences.Objectives: To assess the efficacy of diet, physical activity and behavioural interventions delivered to parents only for the treatment of overweight and obesity in children aged 5 to 11 years.Search methods: We performed a systematic literature search of databases including the Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, CINAHL and LILACS as well trial registers. We checked references of identified trials and systematic reviews. We applied no language restrictions. The date of the last search was March 2015 for all databases.Selection criteria: We selected randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of diet, physical activity and behavioural interventions delivered to parents only for treating overweight or obesity in children aged 5 to 11 years.Data collection and analysis: Two review authors independently assessed trials for risk of bias and evaluated overall study quality using the GRADE instrument. Where necessary, we contacted authors for additional information.Main results: We included 20 RCTs, including 3057 participants. The number of participants ranged per trial between 15 and 645. Follow-up ranged between 24 weeks and two years. Eighteen trials were parallel RCTs and two were cluster RCTs. Twelve RCTs had two comparisons and eight RCTs had three comparisons. The interventions varied widely; the duration, content, delivery and follow-up of the interventions were heterogeneous. The comparators also differed. This review categorised the comparisons into four groups: parent-only versus parent-child, parent-only versus waiting list controls, parent-only versus minimal contact interventions and parent-only versus other parent-only interventions.Trial quality was generally low with a large proportion of trials rated as high risk of bias on individual risk of bias criteria.In trials comparing a parent-only intervention with a parent-child intervention, the body mass index (BMI) z score change showed a mean difference (MD) at the longest follow-up period (10 to 24 months) of -0.04 (95% confidence interval (CI) -0.15 to 0.08); P = 0.56; 267 participants; 3 trials; low quality evidence. In trials comparing a parent-only intervention with a waiting list control, the BMI z score change in favour of the parent-only intervention at the longest follow-up period (10-12 months) had an MD of -0.10 (95% CI -0.19 to -0.01); P = 0.04; 136 participants; 2 trials; low quality evidence. BMI z score change of parent-only interventions when compared with minimal contact control interventions at the longest follow-up period (9 to 12 months) showed an MD of 0.01 (95% CI -0.07 to 0.09); P = 0.81; 165 participants; 1 trial; low quality evidence. There were few similarities between interventions and comparators across the included trials in the parent-only intervention versus other parent-only interventions and we did not pool these data. Generally, these trials did not show substantial differences between their respective parent-only groups on BMI outcomes.Other outcomes such as behavioural measures, parent-child relationships and health-related quality of life were reported inconsistently. Adverse effects of the interventions were generally not reported, two trials stated that there were no serious adverse effects. No trials reported on all-cause mortality, morbidity or socioeconomic effects.All results need to be interpreted cautiously because of their low quality, the heterogeneous interventions and comparators, and the high rates of non-completion.Authors' conclusions: Parent-only interventions may be an effective treatment option for overweight or obese children aged 5 to 11 years when compared with waiting list controls. Parent-only interventions had similar effects compared with parent-child interventions and compared with those with minimal contact controls. However, the evidence is at present limited; some of the trials had a high risk of bias with loss to follow-up being a particular issue and there was a lack of evidence for several important outcomes. The systematic review has identified 10 ongoing trials that have a parent-only arm, which will contribute to future updates. These trials will improve the robustness of the analyses by type of comparator, and may permit subgroup analysis by intervention component and the setting. Trial reports should provide adequate details about the interventions to be replicated by others. There is a need to conduct and report cost-effectiveness analyses in future trials in order to establish whether parent-only interventions are more cost-effective than parent-child interventions.US: http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD012008/abstractRecord #65 of 271ID: CD005102AU: Nield LucieAU: Summerbell Carolyn DAU: Hooper LeeAU: Whittaker VictoriaAU: Moore Helen JTI: Dietary advice for the prevention of type 2 diabetes mellitus in adultsSO: Cochrane Database of Systematic ReviewsYR: 2016NO: 1PB: John Wiley & Sons, LtdKY: Diet;Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2 [prevention & control];Energy Intake;Exercise;Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic;Adult[checkword];Humans[checkword]CC: ENDOCDOI: 10.1002/14651858.CD005102.pub3AB: Review status was set to withdrawn.

It can occur in all trimesters of pregnancy. The symptoms of heartburn in pregnancy may be frequent, severe and distressing, but serious complications are rare. Many interventions have been used for the treatment of heartburn in pregnancy. These interventions include advice on diet, lifestyle modification and medications. However, there has been no evidence-based recommendation for the treatment of heartburn in pregnancy.Objectives: To assess the effects of interventions for relieving heartburn in pregnancy.Search methods: We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (30 June 2015), ClinicalTrials.gov (2 March 2015), Asian & Oceanic Congress of Obstetrics & Gynaecology (AOCOG) conference proceedings (20-23 October 2013, Centara Grand & Bangkok Convention Centre, Bangkok, Thailand), and reference lists of retrieved studies.Selection criteria: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTS of interventions for heartburn in pregnancy compared with another intervention, or placebo, or no intervention. Cluster-RCTs would have been eligible for inclusion but none were identified. We excluded studies available as abstracts only and those using a cross-over design.Interventions could include advice on diet, lifestyle modification and medications (such as antacids, sucralfate, histamine 2-receptor antagonists, promotility drugs and proton pump inhibitors (PPIs)).Data collection and analysis: Two review authors independently assessed trials for inclusion and risk of bias, extracted data and checked them for accuracy.Main results: We included nine RCTs involving 725 women. However, five trials did not contribute data. Four trials involving 358 women contributed data. Trials were generally at mixed risk of bias.We only identified data for three comparisons: pharmaceutical treatment versus placebo or no treatment; acupuncture versus no treatment and pharmacological intervention versus advice on dietary and lifestyle changes. Pharmaceutical treatment compared with placebo or no treatmentTwo trials evaluated any pharmaceutical treatment compared with placebo or no treatment. One trial examined a treatment rarely used nowadays (intramuscular prostigmine 0.5 mg versus placebo). One trial evaluated the effect of magnesium and aluminium hydroxide plus simethicone liquid and tablet compared with placebo. For the primary outcome of this review (relief of heartburn), women who received pharmaceutical treatment reported complete heartburn relief more often than women receiving no treatment or placebo (risk ratio (RR) 1.85, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.36 to 2.50 in two RCTs of 256 women, I2 = 0%, moderate-quality evidence). Data on partial relief of heartburn were heterogenous and showed no clear difference (average RR 1.35, 95% CI 0.38 to 4.76 in two RCTs of 256 women, very low-quality evidence). In terms of secondary outcomes, there was no clear difference in the rate of side effects between the pharmaceutical treatment group and the placebo/no treatment group (RR 0.63, 95% CI 0.21 to 1.89 in two RCTs of 256 women, very low-quality evidence). Pharmacological intervention versus advice on dietary and lifestyle choicesOne study compared 1 g of sucralfate with advice on dietary and lifestyle choices in treating heartburn. More women in the sucralfate group experienced complete relief of heartburn compared to women who received advice on diet and lifestyle choices (RR 2.41, 95% CI 1.42 to 4.07; participants = 65; studies = one). The only secondary outcome of interest addressed by this trial was side effects. The evidence was not clear on intervention side effects rate between the two groups (RR 1.74, 95% CI 0.07 to 41.21; participants = 66; studies = one). There was only one instance of side effects in the pharmacological group. Acupuncture compared with no treatmentOne trial evaluated acupuncture compared with no treatment but did not report data relating to this review's primary outcome (relief of heartburn). In terms of secondary outcomes, there was no difference in the rate of side effects between women who had acupuncture and women who had no treatment (RR 2.43, 95% CI 0.11 to 55.89 in one RCT of 36 women). With regard to quality of life, women who had acupuncture reported improved ability to sleep (RR 2.80, 95% CI 1.14 to 6.86) and eat (RR 2.40, 95% CI 1.11 to 5.18 in one RCT of 36 women).The following secondary outcomes were not reported upon in any of the trials included in the review: miscarriage, preterm labour, maternal satisfaction, fetal anomalies, intrauterine growth restriction, low birthweight.Authors' conclusions: There are no large-scale RCTs to assess heartburn relief in pregnancy. This review of nine small studies (which involved data from only four small studies) indicates that there are limited data suggesting that heartburn in pregnancy could be completely relieved by pharmaceutical treatment. Three outcomes were assessed and assigned a quality rating using the GRADE methods. Evidence from two trials for the outcome of complete relief of heartburn was assessed as of moderate quality. Evidence for the outcomes of partial heartburn relief and side effects was graded to be of very low quality. Downgrading decisions were based in part on the small size of the trials and on heterogenous and imprecise results.There are insufficient data to assess acupuncture versus no treatment and no data to assess other comparisons (miscarriage, preterm labour, maternal satisfaction, fetal anomalies, intrauterine growth restriction, low birthweight).Further RCTs are needed to fully evaluate the effectiveness of interventions for heartburn in pregnancy. Future research should also address other medications such as histamine 2-receptor antagonists, promotility drugs, proton pump inhibitors, and a raft-forming alginate reflux suppressant in treatment of heartburn in pregnancy. More research is needed on acupuncture and other complimentary therapies as treatments for heartburn in pregnancy. Future research should also evaluate any adverse outcomes, maternal satisfaction with treatment and measure pregnant women's quality of life in relation to the intervention.US: http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD011379.pub2/abstractRecord #67 of 271ID: CD011094AU: Al-Khudairy LenaAU: Hartley LouiseAU: Clar ChristineAU: Flowers NadineAU: Hooper LeeAU: Rees KarenTI: Omega 6 fatty acids for the primary prevention of cardiovascular diseaseSO: Cochrane Database of Systematic ReviewsYR: 2015NO: 11PB: John Wiley & Sons, LtdKY: Blood Pressure;Cardiovascular Diseases [prevention & control];Cholesterol [blood];Cholesterol, HDL [blood];Cholesterol, LDL [blood];Fatty Acids, Omega-6 [administration & dosage];Primary Prevention [methods];Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic;Triglycerides [blood];Adult[checkword];Aged[checkword];Female[checkword];Humans[checkword];Male[checkword];Middle Aged[checkword]DOI: 10.1002/14651858.CD011094.pub2AB: Background: Omega 6 plays a vital role in many physiological functions but there is controversy concerning its effect on cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk. There is conflicting evidence whether increasing or decreasing omega 6 intake results in beneficial effects.Objectives: The two primary objectives of this Cochrane review were to determine the effectiveness of:  1. Increasing omega 6 (Linoleic acid (LA), Gamma-linolenic acid (GLA), Dihomo-gamma-linolenic acid (DGLA), Arachidonic acid (AA), or any combination) intake in place of saturated or monounsaturated fats or carbohydrates for the primary prevention of CVD.  2. Decreasing omega 6 (LA, GLA, DGLA, AA, or any combination) intake in place of carbohydrates or protein (or both) for the primary prevention of CVD.Search methods: We searched the following electronic databases up to 23 September 2014: the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) on the Cochrane Library (Issue 8 of 12, 2014); MEDLINE (Ovid) (1946 to September week 2, 2014); EMBASE Classic and EMBASE (Ovid) (1947 to September 2014); Web of Science Core Collection (Thomson Reuters) (1990 to September 2014); Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects (DARE) and Health Technology Assessment Database, and Health Economics Evaluations Database on the Cochrane Library (Issue 3 of 4, 2014). We searched trial registers and reference lists of reviews for further studies. We applied no language restrictions.Selection criteria: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of interventions stating an intention to increase or decrease omega 6 fatty acids, lasting at least six months, and including healthy adults or adults at high risk of CVD. The comparison group was given no advice, no supplementation, a placebo, a control diet, or continued with their usual diet. The outcomes of interest were CVD clinical events (all-cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality, non-fatal end points) and CVD risk factors (changes in blood pressure, changes in blood lipids, occurrence of type 2 diabetes). We excluded trials involving exercise or multifactorial interventions to avoid confounding.Data collection and analysis: Two review authors independently selected trials for inclusion, extracted the data, and assessed the risk of bias in the included trials.Main results: We included four RCTs (five papers) that randomised 660 participants. No ongoing trials were identified. All included trials had at least one domain with an unclear risk of bias. There were no RCTs of omega 6 intake reporting CVD clinical events. Three trials investigated the effect of increased omega 6 intake on lipid levels (total cholesterol, low density lipoprotein (LDL-cholesterol), and high density lipoprotein (HDL-cholesterol)), two trials reported triglycerides, and two trials reported blood pressure (diastolic and systolic blood pressure). Two trials, one with two relevant intervention arms, investigated the effect of decreased omega 6 intake on blood pressure parameters and lipid levels (total cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, and HDL-cholesterol) and one trial reported triglycerides. Our analyses found no statistically significant effects of either increased or decreased omega 6 intake on CVD risk factors.Two studies were supported by funding from the UK Food Standards Agency and Medical Research Council. One study was supported by Lipid Nutrition, a commercial company in the Netherlands and the Dutch Ministry of Economic Affairs. The final study was supported by grants from the Finnish Food Research Foundation, Finnish Heart Research Foundation, Aarne and Aili Turnen Foundation, and the Research Council for Health, Academy of Finland.Authors' conclusions: We found no studies examining the effects of either increased or decreased omega 6 on our primary outcome CVD clinical endpoints and insufficient evidence to show an effect of increased or decreased omega 6 intake on CVD risk factors such as blood lipids and blood pressure. Very few trials were identified with a relatively small number of participants randomised. There is a need for larger well conducted RCTs assessing cardiovascular events as well as cardiovascular risk factors.US: http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD011094.pub2/abstractRecord #68 of 271ID: CD005548AU: Duley LeliaAU: Henderson-Smart David JAU: Meher ShireenTI: Altered dietary salt for preventing pre-eclampsia, and its complicationsSO: Cochrane Database of Systematic ReviewsYR: 2005NO: 4PB: John Wiley & Sons, LtdKY: Diet, Sodium-Restricted;Pre-Eclampsia [prevention & control];Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic;Sodium Chloride, Dietary [administration & dosage];Female[checkword];Humans[checkword];Pregnancy[checkword]CC: PREGDOI: 10.1002/14651858.CD005548AB: Background: In the past, women have been advised that lowering their salt intake might reduce their risk of developing pre-eclampsia. Although this practice has largely ceased, it remains important to assess the evidence about possible effects of altered dietary salt intake during pregnancy.Objectives: The objective of this review was to assess the effects of altered dietary salt during pregnancy on the risk of developing pre-eclampsia and its complications.Search methods: We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (8 April 2005), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (The Cochrane Library, Issue 1, 2005), and EMBASE (2002 to May 2005). We updated the search of the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register on 1 October 2009 and added the results to the awaiting classification section.Selection criteria: Randomised trials evaluating either reduced or increased dietary salt intake during pregnancy.Data collection and analysis: Two review authors selected trials for inclusion and extracted data independently. Data were entered on Review Manager software for analysis, and double-checked for accuracy.Main results: Two trials were included, with 603 women. Both compared advice to reduce dietary salt intake with advice to continue a normal diet. The confidence intervals were wide and crossed the no-effect line for all the reported outcomes, including pre-eclampsia (relative risk 1.11, 95% confidence interval 0.46 to 2.66). In other words, there was insufficient evidence for reliable conclusions about the effects of advice to reduce dietary salt.Authors' conclusions: In the absence of evidence that advice to alter salt intake during pregnancy has any beneficial effect for prevention of pre-eclampsia or any other outcome, salt consumption during pregnancy should remain a matter of personal preference.[Note: The citation in the awaiting classification section of the review may alter the conclusions of the review once assessed.]US: http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD005548/abstractRecord #69 of 271ID: CD003458AU: Quinlivan RosalineAU: Martinuzzi AndreaAU: Schoser BenediktTI: Pharmacological and nutritional treatment for McArdle disease (Glycogen Storage Disease type V)SO: Cochrane Database of Systematic ReviewsYR: 2014NO: 11PB: John Wiley & Sons, LtdKY: Dietary Supplements;Creatine [administration & dosage];Dietary Carbohydrates [administration & dosage];Dietary Proteins;Glycogen Storage Disease Type V [drug therapy] [therapy];Physical Endurance;Ramipril [therapeutic use];Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic;Sucrose [administration & dosage];Humans[checkword]CC: NEUROMUSCDOI: 10.1002/14651858.CD003458.pub5AB: Background: McArdle disease (Glycogen Storage Disease type V) is caused by an absence of muscle phosphorylase leading to exercise intolerance, myoglobinuria rhabdomyolysis and acute renal failure. This is an update of a review first published in 2004.Objectives: To review systematically the evidence from randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of pharmacological or nutritional treatments for improving exercise performance and quality of life in McArdle disease.Search methods: We searched the Cochrane Neuromuscular Disease Group Specialized Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE and EMBASE on 11 August 2014.Selection criteria: We included RCTs (including cross-over studies) and quasi-RCTs. We included unblinded open trials and individual patient studies in the discussion. Interventions included any pharmacological agent or nutritional supplement. Primary outcome measures included any objective assessment of exercise endurance (for example aerobic capacity (VO2) max, walking speed, muscle force or power and fatigability). Secondary outcome measures included metabolic changes (such as reduced plasma creatine kinase and a reduction in the frequency of myoglobinuria), subjective measures (including quality of life scores and indices of disability) and serious adverse events.Data collection and analysis: Three review authors checked the titles and abstracts identified by the search and reviewed the manuscripts. Two review authors independently assessed the risk of bias of relevant studies, with comments from a third author. Two authors extracted data onto a specially designed form.Main results: We identified 31 studies, and 13 fulfilled the criteria for inclusion. We described trials that were not eligible for the review in the Discussion. The included studies involved a total of 85 participants, but the number in each individual trial was small; the largest treatment trial included 19 participants and the smallest study included only one participant. There was no benefit with: D-ribose, glucagon, verapamil, vitamin B6, branched chain amino acids, dantrolene sodium, and high-dose creatine. Minimal subjective benefit was found with low dose creatine and ramipril only for patients with a polymorphism known as the D/D angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) phenotype. A carbohydrate-rich diet resulted in better exercise performance compared with a protein-rich diet. Two studies of oral sucrose given at different times and in different amounts before exercise showed an improvement in exercise performance. Four studies reported adverse effects. Oral ribose caused diarrhoea and symptoms suggestive of hypoglycaemia including light-headedness and hunger. In one study, branched chain amino acids caused a deterioration of functional outcomes. Dantrolene was reported to cause a number of adverse effects including tiredness, somnolence, dizziness and muscle weakness. Low dose creatine (60 mg/kg/day) did not cause side-effects but high-dose creatine (150 mg/kg/day) worsened the symptoms of myalgia.Authors' conclusions: Although there was low quality evidence of improvement in some parameters with creatine, oral sucrose, ramipril and a carbohydrate-rich diet, none was sufficiently strong to indicate significant clinical benefit.US: http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD003458.pub5/abstractRecord #70 of 271ID: CD006162AU: Curioni CintiaAU: André CharlesTI: Rimonabant for overweight or obesitySO: Cochrane Database of Systematic ReviewsYR: 2006NO: 4PB: John Wiley & Sons, LtdKY: Anti-Obesity Agents [adverse effects] [therapeutic use];Diet, Reducing;Obesity [drug therapy];Overweight [drug effects];Piperidines [adverse effects] [therapeutic use];Pyrazoles [adverse effects] [therapeutic use];Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic;Weight Loss [drug effects];Adult[checkword];Humans[checkword]CC: ENDOCDOI: 10.1002/14651858.CD006162.pub2AB: Background: Worldwide, the prevalence of obesity and overweight in industrialized countries and in a substantial number of developing countries is increasing at an alarming rate. Rimonabant is a selective cannabinoid-1 receptor antagonist that has been investigated for its efficacy in reducing body weight and associated risk factors in obese people. Phase III trials are now under way to test the use of rimonabant for long-term weight-loss. Given the prevalence of overweight and obesity, it is important to establish the efficacy and safety of rimonabant.Objectives: To assess the effects of rimonabant in overweight and obese people.Search methods: MEDLINE, EMBASE, The Cochrane Library, LILACS, databases of ongoing trials and reference lists were used to identify relevant trials.Selection criteria: Randomised controlled trials comparing rimonabant with placebo or other weight loss interventions in overweight or obese adults.Data collection and analysis: Two reviewers independently assessed all potentially relevant citations for inclusion and methodological quality. The primary outcome measures were weight loss change, morbidity and adverse effects occurrence.Main results: Four studies evaluating rimonabant 20 mg versus rimonabant 5 mg versus placebo in addition to a hypocaloric diet lasting at least one year were included. Compared with placebo, rimonabant 20 mg produced a 4.9 kg greater reduction in body weight in trials with one-year results. Improvements in waist circumference, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, triglyceride levels and systolic and diastolic blood pressure were also seen. However, the results with rimonabant 5 mg demonstrated a weight reduction which was only 1.3 kg greater when compared with placebo. No clinically relevant effects on plasma lipids and blood pressure were found. Rimonabant 20 mg caused significant more adverse effects both of general and serious nature, especially of nervous system, psychiatric or gastro-intestinal origin. Attrition rates were approximately 40% at the end of one year.Authors' conclusions: The use of rimonabant after one year produces modest weight loss of approximately 5%. Even modest amounts of weight loss may be potentially beneficial. The observed results should be interpreted with some caution, though, since the evaluated studies presented some deficiencies in methodological quality. Studies with longer follow-ups after the end of treatment and of more rigorous quality should be done before definitive recommendations can be made regarding the role of this new medication in the management of overweight or obese patients.US: http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD006162.pub2/abstractRecord #71 of 271ID: CD006061AU: Priebe MarionAU: van Binsbergen JaapAU: de Vos RienAU: Vonk Roel JTI: Whole grain foods for the prevention of type 2 diabetes mellitusSO: Cochrane Database of Systematic ReviewsYR: 2008NO: 1PB: John Wiley & Sons, LtdKY: Edible Grain [adverse effects];Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2 [prevention & control];Dietary Fiber [administration & dosage];Insulin Resistance;Humans[checkword]CC: ENDOCDOI: 10.1002/14651858.CD006061.pub2AB: Background: Diet as one aspect of lifestyle is thought to be one of the modifiable risk factors for the development of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Information is needed as to which components of the diet could be protective for this disease.Objectives: To asses the effects of whole-grain foods for the prevention of T2DM.Search methods: We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL and AMED.Selection criteria: We selected cohort studies with a minimum duration of five years that assessed the association between intake of whole-grain foods or cereal fibre and incidence of T2DM. Randomised controlled trials lasting at least six weeks were selected that assessed the effect of a diet rich in whole-grain foods compared to a diet rich in refined grain foods on T2DM and its major risk factors.Data collection and analysis: Two authors independently selected the studies, assessed study quality and extracted data. Data of studies were not pooled because of methodological diversity.Main results: One randomised controlled trial and eleven prospective cohort studies were identified. The randomised controlled trial, which was of low methodological quality, reported the change in insulin sensitivity in 12 obese hyperinsulinemic participants after six-week long interventions. Intake of whole grain foods resulted in a slight improvement of insulin sensitivity and no adverse effects. Patient satisfaction, health related quality of life, total mortality and morbidity was not reported.   Four of the eleven cohort studies measured cereal fibre intake, three studies whole grain intake and two studies both. Two studies measured the change in whole grain food intake and one of them also change in cereal fibre intake. The incidence of T2DM was assessed in nine studies and changes in weight gain in two studies. The prospective studies consistently showed a reduced risk for high intake of whole grain foods (27% to 30%) or cereal fibre (28% to 37%) on the development of T2DM.Authors' conclusions: The evidence from only prospective cohort trials is considered to be too weak to be able to draw a definite conclusion about the preventive effect of whole grain foods on the development of T2DM. Properly designed long-term randomised controlled trials are needed. To facilitate this, further mechanistic research should focus on finding a set of relevant intermediate endpoints for T2DM and on identifying genetic subgroups of the population at risk that are most susceptible to dietary intervention.US: http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD006061.pub2/abstractRecord #72 of 271ID: CD009436AU: Cao HuijuanAU: Yang GuoyanAU: Wang YuyiAU: Liu Jian PingAU: Smith Caroline AAU: Luo HuiAU: Liu YuemingTI: Complementary therapies for acne vulgarisSO: Cochrane Database of Systematic ReviewsYR: 2015NO: 1PB: John Wiley & Sons, LtdCC: SKINDOI: 10.1002/14651858.CD009436.pub2AB: Background: Acne is a chronic skin disease characterised by inflamed spots and blackheads on the face, neck, back, and chest. Cysts and scarring can also occur, especially in more severe disease. People with acne often turn to complementary and alternative medicine (CAM), such as herbal medicine, acupuncture, and dietary modifications, because of their concerns about the adverse effects of conventional medicines. However, evidence for CAM therapies has not been systematically assessed.Objectives: To assess the effects and safety of any complementary therapies in people with acne vulgaris.Search methods: We searched the following databases from inception up to 22 January 2014: the Cochrane Skin Group Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2014,Issue 1), MEDLINE (from 1946), Embase (from 1974), PsycINFO (from 1806), AMED (from 1985), CINAHL (from 1981), Scopus (from 1966), and a number of other databases listed in the Methods section of the review. The Cochrane CAM Field Specialised Register was searched up to May 2014. We also searched five trials registers and checked the reference lists of articles for further references to relevant trials.Selection criteria: We included parallel-group randomised controlled trials (or the first phase data of randomised cross-over trials) of any kind of CAM, compared with no treatment, placebo, or other active therapies, in people with a diagnosis of acne vulgaris.Data collection and analysis: Three authors collected data from each included trial and evaluated the methodological quality independently. They resolved disagreements by discussion and, as needed, arbitration by another author.Main results: We included 35 studies, with a total of 3227 participants. We evaluated the majority as having unclear risk of selection, attrition, reporting, detection, and other biases. Because of the clinical heterogeneity between trials and the incomplete data reporting, we could only include four trials in two meta-analyses, with two trials in each meta-analysis. The categories of CAM included herbal medicine, acupuncture, cupping therapy, diet, purified bee venom (PBV), and tea tree oil. A pharmaceutical company funded one trial; the other trials did not report their funding sources.Our main primary outcome was 'Improvement of clinical signs assessed through skin lesion counts', which we have reported as 'Change in inflammatory and non-inflammatory lesion counts', 'Change of total skin lesion counts', 'Skin lesion scores', and 'Change of acne severity score'. For 'Change in inflammatory and non-inflammatory lesion counts', we combined 2 studies that compared a low- with a high-glycaemic-load diet (LGLD, HGLD) at 12 weeks and found no clear evidence of a difference between the groups in change in non-inflammatory lesion counts (mean difference (MD) -3.89, 95% confidence interval (CI) -10.07 to 2.29, P = 0.10, 75 participants, 2 trials, low quality of evidence). However, although data from 1 of these 2 trials showed benefit of LGLD for reducing inflammatory lesions (MD -7.60, 95% CI -13.52 to -1.68, 43 participants, 1 trial) and total skin lesion counts (MD -8.10, 95% CI -14.89 to -1.31, 43 participants, 1 trial) for people with acne vulgaris, data regarding inflammatory and total lesion counts from the other study were incomplete and unusable in synthesis.Data from a single trial showed potential benefit of tea tree oil compared with placebo in improving total skin lesion counts (MD -7.53, 95% CI -10.40 to -4.66, 60 participants, 1 trial, low quality of evidence) and acne severity scores (MD -5.75, 95% CI -9.51 to -1.99, 60 participants, 1 trial). Another trial showed pollen bee venom to be better than control in reducing numbers of skin lesions (MD -1.17, 95% CI -2.06 to -0.28, 12 participants, 1 trial).Results from the other 31 trials showed inconsistent effects in terms of whether acupuncture, herbal medicine, or wet-cupping therapy were superior to controls in increasing remission or reducing skin lesions.Twenty-six of the 35 included studies reported adverse effects; they did not report any severe adverse events, but specific included trials reported mild adverse effects from herbal medicines, wet-cupping therapy, and tea tree oil gel.Thirty trials measured two of our secondary outcomes, which we combined and expressed as 'Number of participants with remission'. We were able to combine 2 studies (low quality of evidence), which compared Ziyin Qinggan Xiaocuo Granule and the antibiotic, minocycline (100 mg daily) (worst case = risk ratio (RR) 0.49, 95% CI 0.09 to 2.53, 2 trials, 206 participants at 4 weeks; best case = RR 2.82, 95% CI 0.82 to 9.06, 2 trials, 206 participants at 4 weeks), but there was no clear evidence of a difference between the groups.None of the included studies assessed 'Psychosocial function'.Two studies assessed 'Quality of life', and significant differences in favour of the complementary therapy were found in both of them on 'feelings of self-worth' (MD 1.51, 95% CI 0.88 to 2.14, P < 0.00001, 1 trial, 70 participants; MD 1.26, 95% CI 0.20 to 2.32, 1 trial, 46 participants) and emotional functionality (MD 2.20, 95% CI 1.75 to 2.65, P < 0.00001, 1 trial, 70 participants; MD 0.93, 95% CI 0.17 to 1.69, 1 trial, 46 participants).Because of limitations and concerns about the quality of the included studies, we could not draw a robust conclusion for consistency, size, and direction of outcome effects in this review.Authors' conclusions: There is some low-quality evidence from single trials that LGLD, tea tree oil, and bee venom may reduce total skin lesions in acne vulgaris, but there is a lack of evidence from the current review to support the use of other CAMs, such as herbal medicine, acupuncture, or wet-cupping therapy, for the treatment of this condition. There is a potential for adverse effects from herbal medicines; however, future studies need to assess the safety of all of these CAM therapies. Methodological and reporting quality limitations in the included studies weakened any evidence. Future studies should be designed to ensure low risk of bias and meet current reporting standards for clinical trials.US: http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD009436.pub2/abstractRecord #73 of 271ID: CD008322AU: Cramp FionaAU: Hewlett SarahAU: Almeida CeliaAU: Kirwan John RAU: Choy Ernest HSAU: Chalder TrudieAU: Pollock JonAU: Christensen RobinTI: Non-pharmacological interventions for fatigue in rheumatoid arthritisSO: Cochrane Database of Systematic ReviewsYR: 2013NO: 8PB: John Wiley & Sons, LtdKY: Arthritis, Rheumatoid [complications];Diet, Mediterranean;Exercise Therapy [methods];Fatigue [etiology] [therapy];Fatty Acids, Omega-3 [therapeutic use];Pain Management [methods];Psychotherapy [methods];Reflexotherapy;Adult[checkword];Humans[checkword];Middle Aged[checkword]CC: MUSKELDOI: 10.1002/14651858.CD008322.pub2AB: Background: Fatigue is a common and potentially distressing symptom for people with rheumatoid arthritis with no accepted evidence based management guidelines. Non-pharmacological interventions, such as physical activity and psychosocial interventions, have been shown to help people with a range of other long-term conditions to manage subjective fatigue.Objectives: To evaluate the benefit and harm of non-pharmacological interventions for the management of fatigue in people with rheumatoid arthritis. This included any intervention that was not classified as pharmacological in accordance with European Union (EU) Directive 2001/83/EEC.Search methods: The following electronic databases were searched up to October 2012, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL); MEDLINE; EMBASE; AMED; CINAHL; PsycINFO; Social Science Citation Index; Web of Science; Dissertation Abstracts International; Current Controlled Trials Register; The National Research Register Archive; The UKCRN Portfolio Database. In addition, reference lists of articles identified for inclusion were checked for additional studies and key authors were contacted.Selection criteria: Randomised controlled trials were included if they evaluated a non-pharmacological intervention in people with rheumatoid arthritis with self-reported fatigue as an outcome measure.Data collection and analysis: Two review authors selected relevant trials, assessed risk of bias and extracted data. Where appropriate, data were pooled using meta-analysis with a random-effects model.Main results: Twenty-four studies met the inclusion criteria, with a total of 2882 participants with rheumatoid arthritis. Included studies investigated physical activity interventions (n = 6 studies; 388 participants), psychosocial interventions (n = 13 studies; 1579 participants), herbal medicine (n = 1 study; 58 participants), omega-3 fatty acid supplementation (n = 1 study; 81 participants), Mediterranean diet (n = 1 study; 51 participants), reflexology (n = 1 study; 11 participants) and the provision of Health Tracker information (n = 1 study; 714 participants). Physical activity was statistically significantly more effective than the control at the end of the intervention period (standardized mean difference (SMD) -0.36, 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.62 to -0.10; back translated to mean difference of 14.4 points lower, 95% CI -4.0 to -24.8 on a 100 point scale where a lower score means less fatigue; number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) 7, 95% CI 4 to 26) demonstrating a small beneficial effect upon fatigue. Psychosocial intervention was statistically significantly more effective than the control at the end of the intervention period (SMD -0.24, 95% CI -0.40 to -0.07; back translated to mean difference of 9.6 points lower, 95% CI -2.8 to -16.0 on a 100 point scale, lower score means less fatigue; NNTB 10, 95% CI 6 to 33) demonstrating a small beneficial effect upon fatigue. For the remaining interventions meta-analysis was not possible and there was either no statistically significant difference between trial arms or findings were not reported. Only three studies reported any adverse events and none of these were serious, however, it is possible that the low incidence was in part due to poor reporting. The quality of the evidence ranged from moderate quality for physical activity interventions and Mediterranean diet to low quality for psychosocial interventions and all other interventions.Authors' conclusions: This review provides some evidence that physical activity and psychosocial interventions provide benefit in relation to self-reported fatigue in adults with rheumatoid arthritis. There is currently insufficient evidence of the effectiveness of other non-pharmacological interventions.US: http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD008322.pub2/abstractRecord #74 of 271ID: CD000436AU: Pogson ZaraAU: McKeever TriciaTI: Dietary sodium manipulation and asthmaSO: Cochrane Database of Systematic ReviewsYR: 2011NO: 3PB: John Wiley & Sons, LtdKY: Diet, Sodium-Restricted;Asthma [prevention & control];Asthma, Exercise-Induced [prevention & control];Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic;Sodium Chloride, Dietary [administration & dosage];Humans[checkword]CC: AIRWAYSDOI: 10.1002/14651858.CD000436.pub3AB: Background: There is a wide geographical variation in the prevalence of asthma and observational studies have suggested that dietary sodium may play a role.Objectives: To assess the effect of dietary sodium manipulation on asthma control.Search methods: We carried out a search using the Cochrane Airways Group asthma register. We searched the bibliographies of included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) for additional studies. We carried out the most recent search in November 2010.Selection criteria: We considered only RCTs that involved dietary sodium reduction or increased sodium intake in patients with asthma.Data collection and analysis: Both review authors assessed study and extracted data. We conducted data analyses in RevMan 5 using mean differences and random effects.Main results: We identified a total of nine studies in relation to sodium manipulation and asthma, of which five were in people with asthma (318 participants), and four in people with exercise-induced asthma (63 participants). There were no significant benefits of salt restriction on the control of asthma. There was some evidence from the exercise-induced asthma studies that a low sodium diet may improve lung function after exercise and possibly baseline lung function, but this is based on findings from a very small numbers of participants.Authors' conclusions: This review did not find any evidence that dietary sodium reduction significantly improves asthma control. Although dietary sodium reduction may result in improvements in lung function in exercise-induced asthma, the clinical significance of this effect is unclear.US: http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD000436.pub3/abstractRecord #75 of 271ID: CD005205AU: Bath-Hextall Fiona JAU: Jenkinson ClaireAU: Humphreys RosemaryAU: Williams Hywel CTI: Dietary supplements for established atopic eczemaSO: Cochrane Database of Systematic ReviewsYR: 2012NO: 2PB: John Wiley & Sons, LtdKY: Dietary Supplements;Dermatitis, Atopic [diet therapy];Fish Oils [therapeutic use];Plant Oils [therapeutic use];Pyridoxine [therapeutic use];Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic;Selenium [therapeutic use];Vitamin D [therapeutic use];Vitamin E [therapeutic use];Vitamins [therapeutic use];Zinc [therapeutic use];Humans[checkword]CC: SKINDOI: 10.1002/14651858.CD005205.pub3AB: Background: Many people with atopic eczema are reluctant to use the most commonly recommended treatments because they fear the long-term health effects. As a result, many turn to dietary supplements as a possible treatment approach, often with the belief that some essential ingredient is 'missing' in their diet. Various supplements have been proposed, but it is unclear whether any of these interventions are effective.Objectives: To evaluate dietary supplements for treating established atopic eczema/dermatitis.Evening primrose oil, borage oil, and probiotics are covered in other Cochrane reviews.Search methods: We searched the following databases up to July 2010: the Cochrane Skin Group Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) in The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE (from 2005), EMBASE (from 2007), PsycINFO (from 1806), AMED (from 1985), LILACS (from 1982), ISI Web of Science, GREAT (Global Resource of EczemA Trials) database, and reference lists of articles. We searched ongoing trials registers up to April 2011.Selection criteria: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of dietary supplements for the treatment of those with established atopic eczema/dermatitis.Data collection and analysis: Two authors independently screened the titles and abstracts, read the full text of the publications, extracted data, and assessed the risk of bias.Main results: We included 11 studies with a total of 596 participants. Two studies assessed fish oil versus olive oil or corn oil placebo. The following were all looked at in single studies: oral zinc sulphate compared to placebo, selenium versus selenium plus vitamin E versus placebo, vitamin D versus placebo, vitamin D versus vitamin E versus vitamins D plus vitamin E together versus placebo, pyridoxine versus placebo, sea buckthorn seed oil versus sea buckthorn pulp oil versus placebo, hempseed oil versus placebo, sunflower oil (linoleic acid) versus fish oil versus placebo, and DHA versus control (saturated fatty acids of the same energy value). Two small studies on fish oil suggest a possible modest benefit, but many outcomes were explored. A convincingly positive result from a much larger study with a publicly-registered protocol is needed before clinical practice can be influenced.Authors' conclusions: There is no convincing evidence of the benefit of dietary supplements in eczema, and they cannot be recommended for the public or for clinical practice at present. Whilst some may argue that at least supplements do not do any harm, high doses of vitamin D may give rise to serious medical problems, and the cost of long-term supplements may also mount up.US: http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD005205.pub3/abstractRecord #76 of 271ID: CD007275AU: Marteau Theresa MAU: French David PAU: Griffin Simon JAU: Prevost A TAU: Sutton StephenAU: Watkinson ClareAU: Attwood SophieAU: Hollands Gareth JTI: Effects of communicating DNA-based disease risk estimates on risk-reducing behavioursSO: Cochrane Database of Systematic ReviewsYR: 2010NO: 10PB: John Wiley & Sons, LtdKY: Communication;Risk Reduction Behavior;Attitude to Health;DNA [analysis];Diet;Genetic Predisposition to Disease [psychology];Genetic Testing [methods] [psychology];Motivation;Motor Activity;Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic;Smoking Cessation;Adult[checkword];Humans[checkword]CC: COMMUNDOI: 10.1002/14651858.CD007275.pub2AB: Background: There are high expectations regarding the potential for the communication of DNA-based disease risk estimates to motivate behaviour change.Objectives: To assess the effects of communicating DNA-based disease risk estimates on risk-reducing behaviours and motivation to undertake such behaviours.Search methods: We searched the following databases using keywords and medical subject headings: Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, The Cochrane Library, Issue 4 2010), MEDLINE (1950 to April 2010), EMBASE (1980 to April 2010), PsycINFO (1985 to April 2010) using OVID SP, and CINAHL (EBSCO) (1982 to April 2010). We also searched reference lists, conducted forward citation searches of potentially eligible articles and contacted authors of relevant studies for suggestions. There were no language restrictions. Unpublished or in press articles were eligible for inclusion.Selection criteria: Randomised or quasi-randomised controlled trials involving adults (aged 18 years and over) in which one group received actual (clinical studies) or imagined (analogue studies) personalised DNA-based disease risk estimates for diseases for which the risk could plausibly be reduced by behavioural change. Eligible studies had to include a primary outcome measure of risk-reducing behaviour or motivation (e.g. intention) to alter such behaviour.Data collection and analysis: Two review authors searched for studies and independently extracted data. We assessed risk of bias according to the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions. For continuous outcome measures, we report effect sizes as standardised mean differences (SMDs). For dichotomous outcome measures, we report effect sizes as odds ratios (ORs). We obtained pooled effect sizes with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) using the random effects model applied on the scale of standardised differences and log odds ratios.Main results: We examined 5384 abstracts and identified 21 studies as potentially eligible. Following a full text analysis, we included 14 papers reporting results of 7 clinical studies (2 papers report on the same trial) and 6 analogue studies.Of the seven clinical studies, five assessed smoking cessation. Meta-analyses revealed no statistically significant effects on either short-term (less than 6 months) smoking cessation (OR 1.35, 95% CI 0.76 to 2.39, P = 0.31, n = 3 studies) or cessation after six months (OR 1.07, 95% CI 0.64 to 1.78, P = 0.80, n = 4 studies). Two clinical studies assessed diet and found effects that significantly favoured DNA-based risk estimates (OR 2.24, 95% CI 1.17 to 4.27, P = 0.01). No statistically significant effects were found in the two studies assessing physical activity (OR 1.03, 95% CI 0.59 to 1.80, P = 0.92) or the one study assessing medication or vitamin use aimed at reducing disease risks (OR 1.26, 95% CI 0.58 to 2.72, P = 0.56). For the six non-clinical analogue studies, meta-analysis revealed a statistically significant effect of DNA-based risk on intention to change behaviour (SMD 0.16, 95% CI 0.04 to 0.29, P = 0.01).There was no evidence that communicating DNA-based disease risk estimates had any unintended adverse effects. Two studies that assessed fear arousal immediately after the presentation of risk information did, however, report greater fear arousal in the DNA-based disease risk estimate groups compared to comparison groups.The quality of included studies was generally poor. None of the clinical or analogue studies were considered to have a low risk of bias, due to either a lack of clarity in reporting, or where details were reported, evidence of a failure to sufficiently safeguard against the risk of bias.Authors' conclusions: Mindful of the weak evidence based on a small number of studies of limited quality, the results of this review suggest that communicating DNA-based disease risk estimates has little or no effect on smoking and physical activity. It may have a small effect on self-reported diet and on intentions to change behaviour. Claims that receiving DNA-based test results motivates people to change their behaviour are not supported by evidence. Larger and better-quality RCTs are needed.US: http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD007275.pub2/abstractRecord #77 of 271ID: CD007174AU: Tan Hannah BAU: Danilla StefanAU: Murray AlexandraAU: Serra RamónAU: El Dib ReginaAU: Henderson Tom OWAU: Wasiak JasonTI: Immunonutrition as an adjuvant therapy for burnsSO: Cochrane Database of Systematic ReviewsYR: 2014NO: 12PB: John Wiley & Sons, LtdKY: Amino Acids, Branched-Chain [therapeutic use];Burns [immunology] [mortality] [therapy];Fatty Acids, Omega-3 [therapeutic use];Glutamine [therapeutic use];Length of Stay;Malnutrition [immunology] [therapy];Nutrition Therapy [methods];Ornithine [analogs & derivatives] [therapeutic use];Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic;Soybean Proteins [therapeutic use];Vitamins [therapeutic use];Wound Infection [etiology];Humans[checkword]CC: INJDOI: 10.1002/14651858.CD007174.pub2AB: Background: With burn injuries involving a large total body surface area (TBSA), the body can enter a state of breakdown, resulting in a condition similar to that seen with severe lack of proper nutrition. In addition, destruction of the effective skin barrier leads to loss of normal body temperature regulation and increased risk of infection and fluid loss. Nutritional support is common in the management of severe burn injury, and the approach of altering immune system activity with specific nutrients is termed immunonutrition. Three potential targets have been identified for immunonutrition: mucosal barrier function, cellular defence and local or systemic inflammation. The nutrients most often used for immunonutrition are glutamine, arginine, branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs), omega-3 (n-3) fatty acids and nucleotides.Objectives: To assess the effects of a diet with added immunonutrients (glutamine, arginine, BCAAs, n-3 fatty acids (fish oil), combined immunonutrients or precursors to known immunonutrients) versus an isonitrogenous diet (a diet wherein the overall protein content is held constant, but individual constituents may be changed) on clinical outcomes in patients with severe burn injury.Search methods: The search was run on 12 August 2012. We searched the Cochrane Injuries Group's Specialised Register, The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE (OvidSP), Embase (OvidSP), ISI WOS SCI-EXPANDED & CPCI-S and four other databases. We handsearched relevant journals and conference proceedings, screened reference lists and contacted pharmaceutical companies. We updated this search in October 2014, but the results of this updated search have not yet been incorporated.Selection criteria: Randomised controlled trials comparing the addition of immunonutrients to a standard nutritional regimen versus an isonitrogenated diet or another immunonutrient agent.Data collection and analysis: Two review authors were responsible for handsearching, reviewing electronic search results and identifying potentially eligible studies. Three review authors retrieved and reviewed independently full reports of these studies for inclusion. They resolved differences by discussion. Two review authors independently extracted and entered data from the included studies. A third review author checked these data. Two review authors independently assessed the risk of bias of each included study and resolved disagreements through discussion or consultation with the third and fourth review authors. Outcome measures of interest were mortality, hospital length of stay, rate of burn wound infection and rate of non-wound infection (bacteraemia, pneumonia and urinary tract infection).Main results: We identified 16 trials involving 678 people that met the inclusion criteria. A total of 16 trials contributed data to the analysis. Of note, most studies failed to report on randomisation methods and intention-to-treat principles; therefore study results should be interpreted with caution. Glutamine was the most common immunonutrient and was given in seven of the 16 included studies. Use of glutamine compared with an isonitrogenous control led to a reduction in length of hospital stay (mean stay -5.65 days, 95% confidence interval (CI) -8.09 to -3.22) and reduced mortality (pooled risk ratio (RR) 0.25, 95% CI 0.08 to 0.78). However, because of the small sample size, it is likely that these results reflect a false-positive effect. No study findings suggest that glutamine has an effect on burn wound infection or on non-wound infection. All other agents investigated showed no evidence of an effect on mortality, length of stay or burn wound infection or non-wound infection rates.Authors' conclusions: Although we found evidence of an effect of glutamine on mortality reduction, this finding should be taken with care. The number of study participants analysed in this systematic review was not sufficient to permit conclusions that recommend or refute the use of glutamine. Glutamine may be effective in reducing mortality, but larger studies are needed to determine the overall effects of glutamine and other immunonutrition agents.US: http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD007174.pub2/abstractRecord #78 of 271ID: CD009728AU: Martin AnneAU: Saunders David HAU: Shenkin Susan D.AU: Sproule JohnTI: Lifestyle intervention for improving school achievement in overweight or obese children and adolescentsSO: Cochrane Database of Systematic ReviewsYR: 2014NO: 3PB: John Wiley & Sons, LtdKY: Achievement;Educational Status;Exercise;Life Style;Executive Function;Mathematics;Overweight [psychology] [therapy];Pediatric Obesity [psychology] [therapy];Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic;Sensitivity and Specificity;Adolescent[checkword];Child[checkword];Humans[checkword]CC: BEHAVDOI: 10.1002/14651858.CD009728.pub2AB: Background: The prevalence of overweight and obesity in childhood and adolescence is high. Excessive body fat at a young age is likely to persist into adulthood and is associated with physical and psychosocial co-morbidities, as well as lower cognitive, school and later life achievement. Lifestyle changes, including reduced caloric intake, decreased sedentary behaviour and increased physical activity, are recommended for prevention and treatment of child and adolescent obesity. Evidence suggests that lifestyle interventions can benefit cognitive function and school achievement in children of normal weight. Similar beneficial effects may be seen in overweight or obese children and adolescents.Objectives: To assess whether lifestyle interventions (in the areas of diet, physical activity, sedentary behaviour and behavioural therapy) improve school achievement, cognitive function and future success in overweight or obese children and adolescents compared with standard care, waiting list control, no treatment or attention control.Search methods: We searched the following databases in May 2013: CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL Plus, PsycINFO, ERIC, IBSS, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, DARE, ISI Conference Proceedings Citation Index, SPORTDiscus, Database on Obesity and Sedentary Behaviour Studies, Database of Promoting Health Effectiveness Reviews (DoPHER) and Database of Health Promotion Research. In addition, we searched the Network Digital Library of Theses and Dissertations (NDLTD), three trials registries and reference lists. We also contacted researchers in the field.Selection criteria: We included (cluster) randomised and controlled clinical trials of lifestyle interventions for weight management in overweight or obese children three to 18 years of age. Studies in children with medical conditions known to affect weight status, school achievement and cognitive function were excluded.Data collection and analysis: Two review authors independently selected studies, extracted data, assessed quality and risk of bias and cross-checked extracts to resolve discrepancies when required. Authors were contacted to obtain further study details and were asked to provide data on the overweight and obese study population when they were not reported separately.Main results: Of 529 screened full-text articles, we included in the review six studies (14 articles) of 674 overweight and obese children and adolescents, comprising four studies with multicomponent lifestyle interventions and two studies with physical activity only interventions. We conducted a meta-analysis when possible and a sensitivity analysis to consider the impact of cluster-randomised controlled trials and/or studies at 'high risk' of attrition bias on the intervention effect. We prioritised reporting of the sensitivity analysis when risk of bias and differences in intervention type and duration were suspected to have influenced the findings substantially. Analysis of a single study indicated that school-based healthy lifestyle education combined with nutrition interventions can produce small improvements in overall school achievement (mean difference (MD) 1.78 points on a scale of zero to 100, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.8 to 2.76; P < 0.001; N = 321; moderate-quality evidence). Single component physical activity interventions produced small improvements in mathematics achievement (MD 3.00 points on a scale of zero to 200, 95% CI 0.78 to 5.22; P value = 0.008; one RCT; N = 96; high-quality evidence), executive function (MD 3.00, scale mean 100, standard deviation (SD) 15, 95% CI 0.09 to 5.91; P value = 0.04; one RCT; N = 116) and working memory (MD 3.00, scale mean 100, SD 15, 95% CI 0.51 to 5.49; P value = 0.02; one RCT; N = 116). No evidence suggested an effect of any lifestyle intervention on reading, vocabulary and language achievements, attention, inhibitory control and simultaneous processing. Pooling of data in meta-analyses was restricted by variations in study design. Heterogeneity was present within some meta-analyses and may have been explained by differences in types of interventions. Risk of bias was low for most assessed items; however in half of the studies, risk of bias was detected for attrition, participant selection and blinding. No study provided evidence of the effect of lifestyle interventions on future success. Whether changes in academic and cognitive abilities were connected to changes in body weight status was unclear because of conflicting findings and variations in study design.Authors' conclusions: Despite the large number of childhood obesity treatment trials, evidence regarding their impact on school achievement and cognitive abilities is lacking. Existing studies have a range of methodological issues affecting the quality of evidence. Multicomponent interventions targeting physical activity and healthy diet could benefit general school achievement, whereas a physical activity intervention delivered for childhood weight management could benefit mathematics achievement, executive function and working memory. Although the effects are small, a very large number of children and adolescents could benefit from these interventions. Therefore health policy makers may wish to consider these potential additional benefits when promoting physical activity and healthy eating in schools. Future obesity treatment trials are needed to examine overweight or obese children and adolescents and to report academic and cognitive as well as physical outcomes.US: http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD009728.pub2/abstractRecord #79 of 271ID: CD001283AU: Thien Francis CKAU: De Luca StefanoAU: Woods Rosalie KAU: Abramson Michael JTI: Dietary marine fatty acids (fish oil) for asthma in adults and childrenSO: Cochrane Database of Systematic ReviewsYR: 2002NO: 2PB: John Wiley & Sons, LtdKY: Asthma [diet therapy];Dietary Supplements;Fish Oils [therapeutic use];Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic;Adult[checkword];Child[checkword];Humans[checkword]CC: AIRWAYSDOI: 10.1002/14651858.CD001283AB: Background: Epidemiological studies suggest that a diet high in marine fatty acids (fish oil) may have beneficial effects on inflammatory conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis and possibly asthma.Objectives: (1) To determine the effect of marine n-3 fatty acid (fish oil) supplementation in asthma.   (2) To determine the effect of a diet high in fish oil in asthma.Search methods: We searched the Cochrane Airways Group Specialised Register. We also searched bibliographies of retrieved trials and contacted fish oil manufacturers. Searches were current as of May 2010.Selection criteria: We included randomised controlled trials in patients with asthma more than two years of age. The study duration had to be in excess of four weeks. Double blind trials were preferred, but we also reviewed single-blind and open trials for possible inclusion.All four reviewers read each paper, blind to its identity. Decisions concerning inclusion were made by simple majority. We all performed quality assessment independently.Data collection and analysis: The only comparison possible was between marine n-3 fatty acid supplementation and placebo. There were insufficient trials to examine dietary manipulation alone.Main results: Nine randomised controlled trials conducted between 1986 and 2001 satisfied the inclusion criteria. Seven were of parallel design and two were cross-over studies. Eight compared fish oil with placebo whilst one compared high dose versus low dose marine n-3 fatty acid supplementation. Two studies were conducted in children, whilst the remaining seven studies were conducted in adults. None of the included studies reported asthma exacerbations, health status or hospital admissions.There was no consistent effect on any of the analysable outcomes: FEV1, peak flow rate, asthma symptoms, asthma medication use or bronchial hyper reactivity. One of the studies performed in children which combined dietary manipulation with fish oil supplementation showed improved peak flow and reduced asthma medication use. There were no adverse events associated with fish oil supplements.Authors' conclusions: There is little evidence to recommend that people with asthma supplement or modify their dietary intake of marine n-3 fatty acids (fish oil) in order to improve their asthma control. Equally, there is no evidence that they are at risk if they do so.US: http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD001283/abstractRecord #80 of 271ID: CD001871AU: Waters ElizabethAU: de Silva-Sanigorski AndreaAU: Burford Belinda JAU: Brown TamaraAU: Campbell Karen JAU: Gao YangAU: Armstrong RebeccaAU: Prosser LaurenAU: Summerbell Carolyn DTI: Interventions for preventing obesity in childrenSO: Cochrane Database of Systematic ReviewsYR: 2011NO: 12PB: John Wiley & Sons, LtdKY: Adiposity [physiology];Life Style;Obesity [prevention & control] [psychology];Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic;Treatment Outcome;Adolescent[checkword];Child[checkword];Child, Preschool[checkword];Humans[checkword]CC: VASCDOI: 10.1002/14651858.CD001871.pub3AB: Background: Prevention of childhood obesity is an international public health priority given the significant impact of obesity on acute and chronic diseases, general health, development and well-being. The international evidence base for strategies that governments, communities and families can implement to prevent obesity, and promote health, has been accumulating but remains unclear.Objectives: This review primarily aims to update the previous Cochrane review of childhood obesity prevention research and determine the effectiveness of evaluated interventions intended to prevent obesity in children, assessed by change in Body Mass Index (BMI). Secondary aims were to examine the characteristics of the programs and strategies to answer the questions "What works for whom, why and for what cost?"Search methods: The searches were re-run in CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsychINFO and CINAHL in March 2010 and searched relevant websites. Non-English language papers were included and experts were contacted.Selection criteria: The review includes data from childhood obesity prevention studies that used a controlled study design (with or without randomisation). Studies were included if they evaluated interventions, policies or programs in place for twelve weeks or more. If studies were randomised at a cluster level, 6 clusters were required.Data collection and analysis: Two review authors independently extracted data and assessed the risk of bias of included studies.  Data was extracted on intervention implementation, cost, equity and outcomes. Outcome measures were grouped according to whether they measured adiposity, physical activity (PA)-related behaviours or diet-related behaviours.  Adverse outcomes were recorded. A meta-analysis was conducted using available BMI or standardised BMI (zBMI) score data with subgroup analysis by age group (0-5, 6-12, 13-18 years, corresponding to stages of developmental and childhood settings).Main results: This review includes 55 studies (an additional 36 studies found for this update). The majority of studies targeted children aged 6-12 years.  The meta-analysis included 37 studies of 27,946 children and demonstrated that programmes were effective at reducing adiposity, although not all individual interventions were effective, and there was a high level of observed heterogeneity (I2=82%). Overall, children in the intervention group had a standardised mean difference in adiposity (measured as BMI or zBMI) of -0.15kg/m2 (95% confidence interval (CI): -0.21 to -0.09). Intervention effects by age subgroups were -0.26kg/m2 (95% CI:-0.53 to 0.00) (0-5 years), -0.15kg/m2 (95% CI -0.23 to -0.08) (6-12 years), and -0.09kg/m2 (95% CI -0.20 to 0.03) (13-18 years). Heterogeneity was apparent in all three age groups and could not explained by randomisation status or the type, duration or setting of the intervention.  Only eight studies reported on adverse effects and no evidence of adverse outcomes such as unhealthy dieting practices, increased prevalence of underweight or body image sensitivities was found.  Interventions did not appear to increase health inequalities although this was examined in fewer studies.Authors' conclusions: We found strong evidence to support beneficial effects of child obesity prevention programmes on BMI, particularly for programmes targeted to children aged six to 12 years. However, given the unexplained heterogeneity and the likelihood of small study bias, these findings must be interpreted cautiously. A broad range of programme components were used in these studies and whilst it is not possible to distinguish which of these components contributed most to the beneficial effects observed, our synthesis indicates the following to be promising policies and strategies:·         school curriculum that includes healthy eating, physical activity and body image·         increased sessions for physical activity and the development of fundamental movement skills throughout the school week·         improvements in nutritional quality of the food supply in schools·         environments and cultural practices that support children eating healthier foods and being active throughout each day·         support for teachers and other staff to implement health promotion strategies and activities (e.g. professional development, capacity building activities)·         parent support and home activities that encourage children to be more active, eat more nutritious foods and spend less time in screen based activitiesHowever, study and evaluation designs need to be strengthened, and reporting extended to capture process and implementation factors, outcomes in relation to measures of equity, longer term outcomes, potential harms and costs.Childhood obesity prevention research must now move towards identifying how effective intervention components can be embedded within health, education and care systems and achieve long term sustainable impacts.  US: http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD001871.pub3/abstractRecord #81 of 271ID: CD006401AU: Vuorio AlpoAU: Kuoppala JaanaAU: Kovanen Petri TAU: Humphries Steve EAU: Tonstad SerenaAU: Wiegman AlbertAU: Drogari EuridikiTI: Statins for children with familial hypercholesterolemiaSO: Cochrane Database of Systematic ReviewsYR: 2014NO: 7PB: John Wiley & Sons, LtdKY: Cholesterol, LDL [blood];Hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA Reductase Inhibitors [adverse effects] [therapeutic use];Hyperlipoproteinemia Type II [blood] [drug therapy] [genetics];Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic;Adolescent[checkword];Child[checkword];Child, Preschool[checkword];Female[checkword];Humans[checkword];Male[checkword]CC: CFDOI: 10.1002/14651858.CD006401.pub3AB: Background: Familial hypercholesterolemia is one of the most common inherited metabolic diseases; the average worldwide prevalence of heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia is at least 1 in 500. Diagnosis of familial hypercholesterolemia in children is based on highly elevated low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol level or DNA-based analysis, or both. Coronary atherosclerosis has been detected in men with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia as young as 17 years old and in women with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia at 25 years old. Since the clinical complications of atherosclerosis occur prematurely, especially in men, lifelong hypolipidemic measures, started in childhood, are needed to reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease. In children with familial hypercholesterolemia, diet is as yet the cornerstone of treatment. Anion exchange resins, such as cholestyramine and colestipol, have also been found to be effective, but are poorly tolerated. Since the 1990s statin studies have been carried out among children with familial hypercholesterolemia (aged 7 to 17 years). Statins greatly reduced their serum LDL cholesterol levels. Even though statins seem to be safe and well-tolerated in children, their long-term safety in this age group is not firmly established.Objectives: To assess the effectiveness and safety of statins in children with familial hypercholesterolemia.Search methods: Relevant studies were identified from the Group's Inborn Errors and Metabolism Trials Register and Medline.Date of most recent search: 14 October 2013.Selection criteria: Randomized and controlled clinical studies including participants up to 18 years old, comparing a statin to placebo or to diet alone.Data collection and analysis: Two authors independently assessed studies for inclusion and extracted data.Main results: We found 21 potentially eligible studies, of which we included eight randomized placebo-controlled studies (1074 participants). In general, the intervention and follow-up time was short (median 24 weeks; range from six weeks to two years). Statins reduced the mean LDL cholesterol concentration at all time points. Serum aspartate and alanine aminotransferase, as well as creatinine kinase concentrations, did not differ between treated and placebo groups at any time point. The risks of myopathy and clinical adverse events were very low and also similar in both groups. In one study simvastatin was shown to improve flow-mediated dilatation of the brachial artery, and in another study treatment with pravastatin for two years induced a significant regression in carotid intima media thickness.Authors' conclusions: Statin treatment is an efficient lipid-lowering therapy in children with familial hypercholesterolemia. No significant safety issues were identified. Statin treatment seems to be safe in the short term, but long-term safety is unknown. Children treated with statins should be carefully monitored and followed up by their pediatricians or physicians into adulthood. Large long-term randomized controlled trials are needed to establish the long-term safety issues of statins.US: http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD006401.pub3/abstractRecord #82 of 271ID: CD007506AU: Moran Lisa JAU: Hutchison Samantha KAU: Norman Robert JAU: Teede Helena JTI: Lifestyle changes in women with polycystic ovary syndromeSO: Cochrane Database of Systematic ReviewsYR: 2011NO: 7PB: John Wiley & Sons, LtdKY: Life Style;Abdominal Fat [anatomy & histology];Exercise;Insulin Resistance;Obesity [complications] [therapy];Polycystic Ovary Syndrome [complications] [rehabilitation];Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic;Virilism [therapy];Waist Circumference;Weight Loss;Female[checkword];Humans[checkword]CC: MENSTRDOI: 10.1002/14651858.CD007506.pub3AB: Background: Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) affects 4% to 18% of reproductive-aged women and is associated with reproductive, metabolic and psychological dysfunction. Obesity worsens the presentation of PCOS and weight management (weight loss, maintenance or prevention of excess weight gain) is proposed as an initial treatment strategy, best achieved through lifestyle changes incorporating diet, exercise and behavioural interventions.Objectives: To assess the effectiveness of lifestyle treatment in improving reproductive, anthropometric (weight and body composition), metabolic and quality of life factors in PCOS.Search methods: Electronic databases (Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library), MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, CINAHL, AMED) (date of last search 7/9/2010), controlled trials register, conference abstracts, relevant journals, reference lists of relevant papers and reviews and grey literature databases, with no language restrictions applied.Selection criteria: Randomised controlled trials comparing lifestyle treatment (diet, exercise, behavioural or combined treatments) to minimal or no treatment in women with PCOS.Data collection and analysis: Two authors independently selected trials, assessed methodological quality and risk of bias and extracted data.Main results: Six studies were included with n=164 participants. Three studies compared physical activity to minimal dietary and behavioural advice or no advice. Three studies compared combined dietary, exercise and behavioural interventions to minimal intervention. Risk of bias varied with 4/6 having adequate sequence generation and clinician or outcome assessor blinding and 3/6 having adequate allocation concealment, complete outcome data and being free of selective reporting.  There were no studies assessing the fertility primary outcomes of pregnancy, live birth and miscarriage and no data for meta-analysis on ovulation or menstrual regularity. Lifestyle intervention provided benefits when compared to minimal treatment for secondary reproductive, anthropometric and reproductive outcomes. These included endpoint values for total testosterone (mean difference (MD) -0.27 nmol/L, 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.46 to -0.09, P = 0.004), hirsutism or excess hair growth by the Ferriman-Gallwey score (MD -1.19, 95% CI -2.35 to -0.03, P = 0.04), weight (MD -3.47 kg, 95% CI -4.94 to -2.00, P < 0.00001), waist circumference (MD -1.95 cm, 95% CI -3.34 to -0.57, P = 0.006) and fasting insulin (MD -2.02 µU/mL, 95% CI -3.28 to -0.77, P = 0.002). There was no evidence of effect of lifestyle for body mass index, free androgen index, sex hormone binding globulin, glucose or cholesterol levels; and no data for quality of life, patient satisfaction or acne.Authors' conclusions: Lifestyle intervention improves body composition, hyperandrogenism (high male hormones and clinical effects) and insulin resistance in women with PCOS. There was no evidence of effect for lifestyle intervention on improving glucose tolerance or lipid profiles and no literature assessing clinical reproductive outcomes, quality of life and treatment satisfaction.US: http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD007506.pub3/abstractRecord #83 of 271ID: CD005379AU: Sydenham EmmaAU: Dangour Alan DAU: Lim Wee-ShiongTI: Omega 3 fatty acid for the prevention of cognitive decline and dementiaSO: Cochrane Database of Systematic ReviewsYR: 2012NO: 6PB: John Wiley & Sons, LtdKY: Cognition Disorders [prevention & control];Dementia [prevention & control];Fatty Acids, Omega-3 [therapeutic use];Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic;Aged[checkword];Aged, 80 and over[checkword];Female[checkword];Humans[checkword];Male[checkword]DOI: 10.1002/14651858.CD005379.pub3AB: Background: Evidence from observational studies suggests that diets high in omega-3 long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) may protect people from cognitive decline and dementia. The strength of this potential protective effect has recently been tested in randomised controlled trials.Objectives: To assess the effects of omega-3 PUFA supplementation for the prevention of dementia and cognitive decline in cognitively healthy older people.Search methods: We searched ALOIS - the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group’s Specialized Register on 6 April 2012 using the terms: "omega 3", PUFA, "fatty acids", "fatty acid", fish, linseed, eicosapentaenoic, docosahexaenoic.Selection criteria: Randomised controlled trials of an omega-3 PUFA intervention which was provided for a minimum of six months to participants aged 60 years and over who were free from dementia or cognitive impairment at the beginning of the study. Two review authors independently assessed all trials.Data collection and analysis: The review authors sought and extracted data on incident dementia, cognitive function, safety and adherence, either from published reports or by contacting the investigators for original data. Data were extracted by two review authors. We calculated mean difference (MD) or standardised mean differences (SMD) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) on an intention-to-treat basis, and summarised narratively information on safety and adherence.Main results: Information on cognitive function at the start of a study was available on 4080 participants randomised in three trials. Cognitive function data were available on 3536 participants at final follow-up.In two studies participants received gel capsules containing either omega-3 PUFA (the intervention) or olive or sunflower oil (placebo) for six or 24 months. In one study, participants received margarine spread for 40 months; the margarine for the intervention group contained omega-3 PUFA. Two studies had cognitive health as their primary outcome; one study of cardiovascular disease included cognitive health as an additional outcome.None of the studies examined the effect of omega-3 PUFA on incident dementia. In two studies involving 3221 participants there was no difference between the omega-3 and placebo group in mini-mental state examination score at final follow-up (following 24 or 40 months of intervention); MD -0.07 (95% CI -0.25 to 0.10). In two studies involving 1043 participants, other tests of cognitive function such as word learning, digit span and verbal fluency showed no beneficial effect of omega-3 PUFA supplementation. Participants in both the intervention and control groups experienced either small or no cognitive declines during the studies.The main reported side-effect of omega-3 PUFA supplementation was mild gastrointestinal problems. Overall, minor adverse events were reported by fewer than 15% of participants, and reports were balanced between intervention groups. Adherence to the intervention was on average over 90% among people who completed the trials. All three studies included in this review are of high methodological quality.Authors' conclusions: Direct evidence on the effect of omega-3 PUFA on incident dementia is lacking. The available trials showed no benefit of omega-3 PUFA supplementation on cognitive function in cognitively healthy older people. Omega-3 PUFA supplementation is generally well tolerated with the most commonly reported side-effect being mild gastrointestinal problems.Further studies of longer duration are required. Longer-term studies may identify greater change in cognitive function in study participants which may enhance the ability to detect the possible effects of omega-3 PUFA supplementation in preventing cognitive decline in older people.US: http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD005379.pub3/abstractRecord #84 of 271ID: CD009542AU: Yeung Joanne PAU: Kloda Lorie AAU: McDevitt JasonAU: Ben-Shoshan MosheAU: Alizadehfar RezaTI: Oral immunotherapy for milk allergySO: Cochrane Database of Systematic ReviewsYR: 2012NO: 11PB: John Wiley & Sons, LtdKY: Administration, Oral;Desensitization, Immunologic [adverse effects] [methods];Milk [adverse effects] [immunology];Milk Hypersensitivity [immunology] [therapy];Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic;Adult[checkword];Animals[checkword];Child[checkword];Humans[checkword]CC: TOBACCODOI: 10.1002/14651858.CD009542.pub2AB: Background: The mainstay of treatment of IgE-mediated cow milk allergy (IMCMA) is an avoidance diet, which is especially difficult with a ubiquitous food like milk. Milk oral immunotherapy (MOIT) may be an alternative treatment, through desensitization or induction of tolerance.Objectives: We aim to assess the clinical efficacy and safety of MOIT in children and adults with IMCMA as compared to a placebo treatment or avoidance strategy.Search methods: We searched 13 databases for journal articles, conference proceedings, theses and unpublished trials, without language or date restrictions, using a combination of subject headings and text words. The search is up-to-date as of October 1, 2012.Selection criteria: Only randomised controlled trials (RCT) were considered for inclusion. Blinded and open trial designs were included. Children and adults with IMCMA were included. MOIT administered by any protocol were included.Data collection and analysis: A total of 2111 unique records were identified and screened for potential inclusion. Studies were selected, data extracted and methodological quality assessed independently by two reviewers. We attempted to contact the study investigators to inquire about data not published that was required for the analysis. Statistical heterogeneity was assessed using the I² test. We estimated a pooled risk ratio (RR) for each outcome using a Mantel-Haenzel fixed-effect model if statistical heterogeneity was low as evaluated by an I² value less than 50%.Main results: Of 157 records reviewed, 16 were included, representing five trials. In general, the studies were small and had inconsistent methodological rigor. Overall, the quality of evidence was rated as low. Each study used a different MOIT protocol. A total of 196 patients were studied (106 MOIT, 90 control) and all were children. Three studies were blinded and two used an avoidance diet control.  Sixty-six patients (62%) in the MOIT group were able to tolerate a full serving of milk (about 200 mL) compared to seven (8%) of the control group (RR 6.61, 95% CI 3.51 to 12.44). In addition, 27 (25%) in the MOIT group could ingest a partial serving of milk (10 to 184 mL) while none could in the control group (RR 9.34, 95% CI 2.72 to 32.09). None of the studies assessed the patients following a period off immunotherapy. Adverse reactions were common (97 of 106 MOIT patients had at least one symptom), although most were local and mild. Because of variability in reporting methods, adverse effects could not be combined quantitatively. For every 11 patients receiving MOIT, one required intramuscular epinephrine. One patient required it on two occasions.Authors' conclusions: Studies to date have involved small numbers of patients and the quality of evidence is generally low. The current evidence shows that MOIT can lead to desensitization in the majority of individuals with IMCMA although the development of long-term tolerance has not been established. A major drawback of MOIT is the frequency of adverse effects, although most are mild and self-limited. The use of parenteral epinephrine is not infrequent. Because there are no standardized protocols, guidelines would be required prior to incorporating desensitization into clinical practice.US: http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD009542.pub2/abstractRecord #85 of 271ID: CD011625AU: Turawa Eunice BAU: Musekiwa AlfredAU: Rohwer Anke CTI: Interventions for preventing postpartum constipationSO: Cochrane Database of Systematic ReviewsYR: 2015NO: 9PB: John Wiley & Sons, LtdKY: Postpartum Period;Constipation [prevention & control];Dietary Fiber [therapeutic use];Laxatives [therapeutic use];Perineum [injuries];Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic;Adult[checkword];Female[checkword];Humans[checkword]CC: PREGDOI: 10.1002/14651858.CD011625.pub2AB: Background: Postpartum constipation, with symptoms such as pain or discomfort, straining, and hard stool, is a common condition affecting mothers. Haemorrhoids, pain at the episiotomy site, effects of pregnancy hormones and haematinics used in pregnancy can increase the risk of postpartum constipation. Eating a high-fibre diet and increasing fluid intake is usually encouraged, although laxatives are commonly used in relieving constipation. The effectiveness and safety of available interventions for preventing postpartum constipation needs to be ascertained.Objectives: To evaluate the effectiveness and safety of interventions for preventing postpartum constipation.Search methods: We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (30 April 2015), Stellenbosch University database, ProQuest Dissertation and Theses database, World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP), ClinicalTrials.gov (30 April 2015) and reference lists of included studies.Selection criteria: All randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing any intervention for preventing postpartum constipation versus another intervention, placebo or no intervention. Interventions could include pharmacological (e.g. laxatives) and non-pharmacological interventions (e.g. acupuncture, educational and behavioural interventions).We included quasi-randomised trials. Cluster-RCTs were eligible for inclusion but none were identified. Studies using a cross-over design were not eligible for inclusion in this review.Data collection and analysis: Two review authors independently screened the results of the search to select potentially relevant studies, extracted data and assessed risk of bias. Results were pooled in a meta-analysis only where there was no substantial statistical heterogeneity.Main results: We included five trials (1208 postpartum mothers); four compared a laxative with placebo and one compared a laxative alone versus the same laxative plus a bulking agent in women who underwent surgical repair of third degree perineal tears. Trials were poorly reported and risk of bias was unclear for most domains. Overall, there was a high risk of selection and attrition bias. Laxative versus placeboNone of the four trials included in this comparison assessed any of our pre-specified primary outcomes (pain or straining on defecation, incidence of postpartum constipation or changes in quality of life).All four trials reported time to first bowel movement (not pre-specified in our protocol). In one trial, more women in the laxative group had their first bowel movement less than 24 hours after delivery compared to women in the placebo group (risk ratio (RR) 2.90, 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.24 to 3.75, 471 women). Individual trials also reported inconsistent results for days one, two and three after delivery. Pooled results of two trials showed that fewer women in the laxative group were having their first bowel movement at day four compared with controls (average RR 0.36, 95% CI 0.21 to 0.61, 671 women).Regarding secondary outcomes, no trials reported on stool consistency using the Bristol stool form scale orrelief of abdominal pain/discomfort . One trial reported the number of women having loose or watery stools and there were more women who experienced this in the laxative group compared to the placebo group (RR 26.96, 95% CI 3.81 to 191.03, 106 women). One trial found no clear difference in the number of enemas between groups (RR 0.63, 95% CI 0.38 to 1.05, 244 women). One trial reported more women having more than two bowel movements per day in the laxative compared to the placebo group (RR 26.02, 95% CI 1.59 to 426.73, 106 women). Adverse effects were poorly reported; two trials reported the number of women having abdominal cramps, but their results could not be pooled in a meta-analysis due to substantial statistical heterogeneity. In one trial, more women in the laxative group had abdominal cramps compared to the placebo group (RR 4.23, 95% CI 1.75 to 10.19, 471 women), while the other trial showed no difference between groups (RR 0.25, 95% CI 0.03 to 2.20, 200 women). With regards to adverse effects of the intervention on the baby , one trial found no difference in the incidence of loose stools (RR 0.62, 95% CI 0.16 to 2.41, 281 women) or diarrhoea (RR 2.46, 95% CI 0.23 to 26.82, 281 women) between the two groups. Laxative versus laxative plus bulking agentOnly one trial was included in this comparison and reported on pain or straining on defecation in women who underwent surgical repair of third degree perineal tears; there was no reported difference between groups (median (range) data only). No difference was reported in the incidence of postpartum constipation (data not reported) and the outcome changes in quality of life was not mentioned.Time to first bowel movement was reported as a median (range) with no difference between the two groups. In terms of adverse effects , women in the laxative plus stool-bulking group were reported to be at a greater risk of faecal incontinence during the immediate postpartum period (median (range) data only). However the number of women having any episode of faecal incontinence during first 10 days postpartum was reported with no clear difference between the two groups (14/77 (18.2%) versus 23/70 (32.9%), RR 0.55, 95% CI 0.31 to 0.99, 147 women). The trial did not report on adverse effects of the intervention on the babies.The trial reported none of the following pre-specified secondary outcomes: stool consistency using Bristol stool form scale , use of alternative products , laxative agents , enemas , relief of abdominal pain/discomfort and stool frequency .Authors' conclusions: We did not identify any trials assessing educational or behavioural interventions. We identified four trials that examined laxatives versus placebo and one that examined laxatives versus laxatives plus stool bulking agents. Results from trials were inconsistent and there is insufficient evidence to make general conclusions about the effectiveness and safety of laxatives.Further rigorous trials are needed to assess the effectiveness and safety of laxatives during the postpartum period for preventing constipation. Trials assessing educational and behavioural interventions and positions that enhance defecation are also needed. Future trials should report on the following important outcomes: pain or straining on defecation; incidence of postpartum constipation, quality of life, time to first bowel movement after delivery, and adverse effects caused by the intervention such as: nausea or vomiting, pain and flatus.US: http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD011625.pub2/abstractRecord #86 of 271ID: CD000406AU: Smyth Rosalind LAU: Rayner OliTI: Oral calorie supplements for cystic fibrosisSO: Cochrane Database of Systematic ReviewsYR: 2014NO: 11PB: John Wiley & Sons, LtdKY: Dietary Supplements [adverse effects];Energy Intake;Administration, Oral;Child Nutrition Disorders [diet therapy] [etiology];Cystic Fibrosis [complications];Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic;Adult[checkword];Child[checkword];Humans[checkword]CC: CFDOI: 10.1002/14651858.CD000406.pub4AB: Background: Poor nutrition occurs frequently in people with cystic fibrosis (CF) and is associated with other adverse outcomes.

However, they are expensive and there are concerns they may reduce the amount of food eaten and not improve overall energy intake.Objectives: To establish whether in people with CF, oral calorie supplements: increase daily calorie intake; and improve overall nutritional intake, nutritional indices, lung function, survival and quality of life. To assess adverse effects associated with using these supplements.Search methods: We searched the Cochrane CF Trials Register comprising references from comprehensive electronic database searches, handsearches of relevant journals and abstract books of conference proceedings. We contacted companies marketing oral calorie supplements.Last search: 03 July 2014.Selection criteria: Randomised or quasi-randomised controlled trials comparing use of oral calorie supplements for at least one month to increase calorie intake with no specific intervention or additional nutritional advice in people with CF.Data collection and analysis: We independently selected the included trials, assessed risk of bias and extracted data. We contacted the authors of included trials and obtained additional information for two trials.Main results: We identified 21 trials and included three, reporting results from 131 participants lasting between three months and one year. Two trials compared supplements to additional nutritional advice and one to no intervention. Two of the included trials recruited only children. In one trial the risk of bias was low across all domains, in a second trial the risk of bias was largely unclear and in the third mainly low. Blinding of participants was unclear in two of the trials. Also, in one trial the clinical condition of groups appeared to be unevenly balanced at baseline and in another trial there were concerns surrounding allocation concealment. There were no significant differences between people receiving supplements or dietary advice alone for change in weight, height, body mass index, z score or other indices of nutrition or growth. Changes in weight (kg) at three, six and twelve months respectively were: MD 0.32 (95% CI -0.09 to 0.72); MD 0.47 (95% CI -0.07 to 1.02 ); and MD 0.16 (-0.68 to 1.00). Total calorie intake was greater in people taking supplements at 12 months, MD 265.70 (95% CI 42.94 to 488.46). There were no significant differences between the groups for anthropometric measures of body composition, lung function, gastrointestinal adverse effects or activity levels.Authors' conclusions: Oral calorie supplements do not confer any additional benefit in the nutritional management of moderately malnourished children with CF over and above the use of dietary advice and monitoring alone. While nutritional supplements may be used, they should not be regarded as essential. Further randomised controlled trials are needed to establish the role of short-term oral protein energy supplements in people with CF and acute weight loss and also for the long-term nutritional management of adults with CF or advanced lung disease, or both.US: http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD000406.pub4/abstractRecord #87 of 271ID: CD008486AU: Woodward SueAU: Norton ChristineAU: Chiarelli PaulineTI: Biofeedback for treatment of chronic idiopathic constipation in adultsSO: Cochrane Database of Systematic ReviewsYR: 2014NO: 3PB: John Wiley & Sons, LtdKY: Botulinum Toxins, Type A [therapeutic use];Chronic Disease;Constipation [therapy];Diazepam [therapeutic use];Feedback, Physiological [physiology];Laxatives [therapeutic use];Muscle Relaxants, Central [therapeutic use];Neurofeedback [methods];Neuromuscular Agents [therapeutic use];Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic;Adult[checkword];Humans[checkword]CC: IBDDOI: 10.1002/14651858.CD008486.pub2AB: Background: Biofeedback therapy has been used to treat the symptoms of people with chronic constipation referred to specialist services within secondary and tertiary care settings. However, different methods of biofeedback are used within different centres and the magnitude of suggested benefits and comparable effectiveness of different methods of biofeedback has yet to be established.Objectives: To determine the efficacy and safety of biofeedback for the treatment of chronic idiopathic (functional) constipation in adults.Search methods: We searched the following databases from inception to 16 December 2013: CENTRAL, the Cochrane Complementary Medicine Field, the Cochrane IBD/FBD Review Group Specialized Register, MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, British Nursing Index, and PsychINFO. Hand searching of conference proceedings and the reference lists of relevant articles was also undertaken.Selection criteria: All randomised trials evaluating biofeedback in adults with chronic idiopathic constipation were considered for inclusion.Data collection and analysis: The primary outcome was global or clinical improvement as defined by the included studies. Secondary outcomes included quality of life, and adverse events as defined by the included studies. Where possible, we calculated the risk ratio (RR) and corresponding 95% confidence interval (CI) for dichotomous outcomes and the mean difference (MD) and 95% CI for continuous outcomes. We assessed the methodological quality of included studies using the Cochrane risk of bias tool. The overall quality of the evidence supporting each outcome was assessed using the GRADE criteria.Main results: Seventeen eligible studies were identified with a total of 931 participants. Most participants had chronic constipation and dyssynergic defecation. Sixteen of the trials were at high risk of bias for blinding. Attrition bias (4 trials) and other potential bias (5 trials) was also noted. Due to differences between study populations, the heterogeneity of the different samples and large range of different outcome measures, meta-analysis was not possible. Different effect sizes were reported ranging from 40 to 100% of patients who received biofeedback improving following the intervention. While electromyograph (EMG) biofeedback was the most commonly used, there is a lack of evidence as to whether any one method of biofeedback is more effective than any other method of biofeedback. We found low or very low quality evidence that biofeedback is superior to oral diazepam, sham biofeedback and laxatives. One study (n = 60) found EMG biofeedback to be superior to oral diazepam. Seventy per cent (21/30) of biofeedback patients had improved constipation at three month follow-up compared to 23% (7/30) of diazepam patients (RR 3.00, 95% CI 1.51 to 5.98). One study compared manometry biofeedback to sham biofeedback or standard therapy consisting of diet, exercise and laxatives. The mean number of complete spontaneous bowel movements (CSBM) per week at three months was 4.6 in the biofeedback group compared to 2.8 in the sham biofeedback group (MD 1.80, 95% CI 1.25 to 2.35; 52 patients). The mean number of CSBM per week at three months was 4.6 in the biofeedback group compared to 1.9 in the standard care group (MD 2.70, 95% CI 1.99 to 3.41; 49 patients). Another study (n = 109) compared EMG biofeedback to conventional treatment with laxatives and dietary and lifestyle advice. This study found that at both 6 and 12 months 80% (43/54) of biofeedback patients reported clinical improvement compared to 22% (12/55) laxative-treated patients (RR 3.65, 95% CI 2.17 to 6.13). Some surgical procedures (partial division of puborectalis and stapled transanal rectal resection (STARR)) were reported to be superior to biofeedback, although with a high risk of adverse events in the surgical groups (wound infection, faecal incontinence, pain, and bleeding that required further surgical intervention). Successful treatment, defined as a decrease in the obstructed defecation score of > 50% at one year was reported in 33% (3/39) of EMG biofeedback patients compared to 82% (44/54) of STARR patients (RR 0.41, 95% CI 0.26 to 0.65). For the other study the mean constipation score at one year was 16.1 in the balloon sensory biofeedback group compared to 10.5 in the partial division of puborectalis surgery group (MD 5.60, 95% CI 4.67 to 6.53; 40 patients). Another study (n = 60) found no significant difference in efficacy did not demonstrate the superiority of a surgical intervention (posterior myomectomy of internal anal sphincter and puborectalis) over biofeedback. Conflicting results were found regarding the comparative effectiveness of biofeedback and botulinum toxin-A. One small study (48 participants) suggested that botulinum toxin-A injection may have short term benefits over biofeedback, but the relative effects of treatments were uncertain at one year follow-up. No adverse events were reported for biofeedback, although this was not specifically reported in the majority of studies. The results of all of these studies need to be interpreted with caution as GRADE analyses rated the overall quality of the evidence for the primary outcomes (i.e. clinical or global improvement as defined by the studies) as low or very low due to high risk of bias (i.e. open label studies, self-selection bias, incomplete outcome data, and baseline imbalance) and imprecision (i.e. sparse data).Authors' conclusions: Currently there is insufficient evidence to allow any firm conclusions regarding the efficacy and safety of biofeedback for the management of people with chronic constipation. We found low or very low quality evidence from single studies to support the effectiveness of biofeedback for the management of people with chronic constipation and dyssynergic defecation. However, the majority of trials are of poor methodological quality and subject to bias. Further well-designed randomised controlled trials with adequate sample sizes, validated outcome measures (especially patient reported outcome measures) and long-term follow-up are required to allow definitive conclusions to be drawn.US: http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD008486.pub2/abstractRecord #88 of 271ID: CD010846AU: Dickinson HayleyAU: Bain EmilyAU: Wilkinson DominicAU: Middleton PhilippaAU: Crowther Caroline AAU: Walker David WTI: Creatine for women in pregnancy for neuroprotection of the fetusSO: Cochrane Database of Systematic ReviewsYR: 2014NO: 12PB: John Wiley & Sons, LtdKY: Brain Diseases [prevention & control];Creatine [therapeutic use];Fetal Diseases [prevention & control];Neuroprotective Agents [therapeutic use];Female[checkword];Humans[checkword];Pregnancy[checkword]CC: PREGDOI: 10.1002/14651858.CD010846.pub2AB: Background: Creatine is an amino acid derivative and, when phosphorylated (phosphocreatine), is involved in replenishing adenosine triphosphate (ATP) via the creatine kinase reaction. Cells obtain creatine from a diet rich in fish, meat, or dairy and by endogenous synthesis from the amino acids arginine, glycine, and methionine in an approximate 50:50 ratio. Animal studies have shown that creatine may provide fetal neuroprotection when given to the mother through her diet in pregnancy. It is important to assess whether maternally administered creatine in human pregnancy (at times of known, suspected, or potential fetal compromise) may offer neuroprotection to the fetus and may accordingly reduce the risk of adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes, such as cerebral palsy and associated impairments and disabilities arising from fetal brain injury.Objectives: To assess the effects of creatine when used for neuroprotection of the fetus.Search methods: We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (30 November 2014).Selection criteria: We planned to include all published, unpublished, and ongoing randomised trials and quasi-randomised trials. We planned to include studies reported as abstracts only as well as full-text manuscripts. Trials using a cross-over or cluster-randomised design were not eligible for inclusion.We planned to include trials comparing creatine given to women in pregnancy for fetal neuroprotection (regardless of the route, timing, dose, or duration of administration) with placebo, no treatment, or with an alternative agent aimed at providing fetal neuroprotection. We also planned to include comparisons of different regimens for administration of creatine.Data collection and analysis: We identified no completed or ongoing randomised controlled trials.Main results: We found no randomised controlled trials for inclusion in this review.Authors' conclusions: As we did not identify any randomised controlled trials for inclusion in this review, we are unable to comment on implications for practice. Although evidence from animal studies has supported a fetal neuroprotective role for creatine when administered to the mother during pregnancy, no trials assessing creatine in pregnant women for fetal neuroprotection have been published to date. If creatine is established as safe for the mother and her fetus, research efforts should first be directed towards randomised trials comparing creatine with either no intervention (ideally using a placebo), or with alternative agents aimed at providing fetal neuroprotection (including magnesium sulphate for the very preterm infant). If appropriate, these trials should then be followed by studies comparing different creatine regimens (dosage and duration of exposure). Such trials should be high quality and adequately powered to evaluate maternal and infant short and longer-term outcomes (including neurodevelopmental disabilities such as cerebral palsy), and should consider utilisation/costs of health care.US: http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD010846.pub2/abstractRecord #89 of 271ID: CD001059AU: Hofmeyr G JustusAU: Lawrie Theresa AAU: Atallah Álvaro NAU: Duley LeliaAU: Torloni Maria RTI: Calcium supplementation during pregnancy for preventing hypertensive disorders and related problemsSO: Cochrane Database of Systematic ReviewsYR: 2014NO: 6PB: John Wiley & Sons, LtdKY: Calcium, Dietary [administration & dosage];Dietary Supplements;Hypertension [prevention & control];Pre-Eclampsia [mortality] [prevention & control];Pregnancy Complications, Cardiovascular [prevention & control];Premature Birth [prevention & control];Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic;Female[checkword];Humans[checkword];Pregnancy[checkword]DOI: 10.1002/14651858.CD001059.pub4AB: Background: Pre-eclampsia and eclampsia are common causes of serious morbidity and death. Calcium supplementation may reduce the risk of pre-eclampsia, and may help to prevent preterm birth.Objectives: To assess the effects of calcium supplementation during pregnancy on hypertensive disorders of pregnancy and related maternal and child outcomes.Search methods: We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (28 March 2013) and contacted study authors for more data where possible. We updated the search in May 2014 and added the results to the 'Awaiting Classification' section of the review.Selection criteria: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing high-dose (at least 1 g daily of calcium) or low-dose calcium supplementation during pregnancy with placebo or no calcium.Data collection and analysis: We assessed eligibility and trial quality, extracted and double-entered data.Main results: High-dose calcium supplementation (≥1 g/day)We included 14 studies in the review, however one study contributed no data. We included 13 high-quality studies in our meta-analyses (15,730 women). The average risk of high blood pressure (BP) was reduced with calcium supplementation compared with placebo (12 trials, 15,470 women: risk ratio (RR) 0.65, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.53 to 0.81; I² = 74%). There was also a significant reduction in the risk of pre-eclampsia associated with calcium supplementation (13 trials, 15,730 women: RR 0.45, 95% CI 0.31 to 0.65; I² = 70%). The effect was greatest for women with low calcium diets (eight trials, 10,678 women: average RR 0.36, 95% CI 0.20 to 0.65; I² = 76%) and women at high risk of pre-eclampsia (five trials, 587 women: average RR 0.22, 95% CI 0.12 to 0.42; I² = 0%). These data should be interpreted with caution because of the possibility of small-study effect or publication bias.The composite outcome maternal death or serious morbidity was reduced (four trials, 9732 women; RR 0.80, 95% CI 0.65 to 0.97; I² = 0%). Maternal deaths were not significantly different (one trial of 8312 women: calcium group one death versus placebo group six deaths). There was an anomalous increase in the risk of HELLP (haemolysis, elevated liver enzymes and low platelets) syndrome (two trials, 12,901 women: RR 2.67, 95% CI 1.05 to 6.82; I² = 0%) in the calcium group, however, the absolute number of events was low (16 versus six).The average risk of preterm birth was reduced in the calcium group (11 trials, 15,275 women: RR 0.76, 95% CI 0.60 to 0.97; I² = 60%) and amongst women at high risk of developing pre-eclampsia (four trials, 568 women: average RR 0.45, 95% CI 0.24 to 0.83; I² = 60%), but no significant reduction in neonatal high care admission. There was no overall effect on the risk of stillbirth or infant death before discharge from hospital (11 trials 15,665 babies: RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.74 to 1.09; I² = 0%).One study showed a reduction in childhood systolic BP greater than 95th percentile among children exposed to calcium supplementation in utero (514 children: RR 0.59, 95% CI 0.39 to 0.91). In a subset of these children, dental caries at 12 years old was also reduced (195 children, RR 0.73, 95% CI 0.62 to 0.87). Low-dose calcium supplementation (< 1 g/day)We included 10 trials (2234 women) that evaluated low-dose supplementation with calcium alone (4) or in association with vitamin D (3), linoleic acid (2), or antioxidants (1). Most studies recruited women at high risk for pre-eclampsia, and were at high risk of bias, thus the results should be interpreted with caution. Supplementation with low doses of calcium significantly reduced the risk of pre-eclampsia (RR 0.38, 95% CI 0.28 to 0.52; I² = 0%). There was also a reduction in hypertension, low birthweight and neonatal intensive care unit admission.Authors' conclusions: Calcium supplementation (≥ 1 g/day) is associated with a significant reduction in the risk of pre-eclampsia, particularly for women with low calcium diets. The treatment effect may be overestimated due to small-study effects or publication bias. It also reduces preterm birth and the occurrence of the composite outcome 'maternal death or serious morbidity'. We considered these benefits to outweigh the increased risk of HELLP syndrome, which was small in absolute numbers. The World Health Organization recommends calcium 1.5 g to 2 g daily for pregnant women with low dietary calcium intake.The limited evidence on low-dose calcium supplementation suggests a reduction in pre-eclampsia, but needs to be confirmed by larger, high-quality trials. Pending such results, in settings of low dietary calcium where high-dose supplementation is not feasible, the option of lower-dose supplements (500 to 600 mg/day) might be considered in preference to no supplementation.US: http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD001059.pub4/abstractRecord #90 of 271ID: CD000542AU: Zachos MaryAU: Tondeur MelodyAU: Griffiths Anne MarieTI: Enteral nutritional therapy for induction of remission in Crohn's diseaseSO: Cochrane Database of Systematic ReviewsYR: 2007NO: 1PB: John Wiley & Sons, LtdKY: Adrenal Cortex Hormones [therapeutic use];Crohn Disease [therapy];Enteral Nutrition [methods];Food, Formulated [analysis];Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic;Remission Induction;Humans[checkword]CC: IBDDOI: 10.1002/14651858.CD000542.pub2AB: Background: The role of enteral nutrition in Crohn's disease is controversial. Increasing research on the mechanisms by which nutritional therapy improves the clinical well being of patients with Crohn's disease has led to novel formula design and trials comparing two different forms of enteral nutrition. This meta-analysis aims to provide an update on the existing effectiveness data for both corticosteroids versus enteral nutrition and for one form of enteral nutrition versus another for inducing remission of active Crohn's disease.Objectives: To evaluate the effectiveness of exclusive enteral nutrition (EN) as primary therapy to induce remission in Crohn's disease and to examine the importance of formula composition on effectiveness.Search methods: Studies were selected using a computer-assisted search of the on-line bibliographic databases MEDLINE (1966-2006) and EMBASE (1984-2006), as well as the Science Citation Index on Web of Science. Additional citations were sought by manual search of references of articles retrieved from the computerized search, abstracts submitted to major gastroenterologic meetings and published in the journals: American Journal of Gastroenterology, Gut, Gastroenterology, Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition, and Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition, and from the reviewers' personal files or contact with leaders in the field.Selection criteria: All randomized and quasi-randomized controlled trials involving patients with active Crohn's disease defined by a clinical disease activity index were considered for review. Studies evaluating the administration of one type of enteral nutrition to one group of patients and another type of enteral nutrition or conventional corticosteroids to the other group were selected for review.Data collection and analysis: Data were extracted independently by two authors and any discrepancies were resolved by rereading and discussion. For the dichotomous variable, achievement of remission, individual and pooled trial statistics were calculated as odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI); both fixed and random effect models were used. The results for each analysis were tested for heterogeneity using the chi square statistic. The studies were separated into two groups: A. one form of enteral nutrition compared with another form of enteral nutrition and B. one form of enteral nutrition compared with corticosteroids. Subgroup analyses were conducted on the basis of clinical or disease criteria and formula composition. Sensitivity analyses were conducted on the basis of the inclusion of abstract publications, methodologic quality and by random or fixed effects models.Main results: In part A, of the 15 included eligible trials (one abstract) comparing different formulations of EN for the treatment of active CD, 11 compared one (or more) elemental formula to a non-elemental one, three compared enteral diets of similar protein composition but different fat composition, and one compared non-elemental diets differing only in glutamine enrichment. Meta-analysis of ten trials comprising 334 patients demonstrated no difference in the efficacy of elemental versus non-elemental formulas (OR 1.10; 95% CI 0.69 to 1.75). Subgroup analyses performed to evaluate the different types of elemental and non-elemental diets (elemental, semi-elemental and polymeric) showed no statistically significant differences. Further analysis of seven trials including 209 patients treated with EN formulas of differing fat content (low fat: < 20 g/1000 kCal versus high fat: > 20 g/1000 kCal) demonstrated no statistically significant difference in efficacy (OR 1.13; 95% CI 0.63 to 2.01). Similarly, the effect of very low fat content (< 3 g/1000 kCal) or type of fat (long chain triglycerides) were investigated, but did not demonstrate a difference in efficacy in the treatment of active CD, although a non significant trend was demonstrated favoring very low fat and very low long chain triglyceride content. This result should be interpreted with caution due to statistically significant heterogeneity and small sample size. Sensitivity analyses had no significant effects on the results. The role of specific fatty acids or disease characteristics on response to therapy could not be evaluated. In part B, eight trials (including two abstracts) comparing enteral nutrition to steroid therapy met the inclusion criteria for review. Meta-analysis of six trials that included 192 patients treated with enteral nutrition and 160 treated with steroids yielded a pooled OR of 0.33 favouring steroid therapy (95% CI 0.21 to 0.53). A sensitivity analysis including the abstracts resulted in an increase in the number of participants to 212 in the enteral nutrition group and 179 in the steroid group but the meta-analysis yielded a similar result (OR 0.36; 95% CI 0.23 to 0.56). There were inadequate data from full publications to perform further subgroup analyses by age, disease duration and disease location.Authors' conclusions: Corticosteroid therapy is more effective than enteral nutrition for inducing remission of active Crohn's disease as was found in previous systematic reviews. Protein composition does not influence the effectiveness of EN in the treatment of active CD. A non significant trend favouring very low fat and/or very low long chain triglyceride content exists but larger trials are required to explore the significance of this finding.US: http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD000542.pub2/abstractRecord #91 of 271ID: CD004731AU: Yi Sarah HLAU: Singh Rani HTI: Protein substitute for children and adults with phenylketonuriaSO: Cochrane Database of Systematic ReviewsYR: 2015NO: 2PB: John Wiley & Sons, LtdKY: Food, Formulated;Dietary Proteins [administration & dosage];Phenylalanine [blood];Phenylalanine Hydroxylase [deficiency];Phenylketonurias [diet therapy] [therapy];Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic;Adult[checkword];Child[checkword];Humans[checkword]CC: CFDOI: 10.1002/14651858.CD004731.pub4AB: Background: Phenylketonuria is an inherited metabolic disorder characterised by an absence or deficiency of the enzyme phenylalanine hydroxylase. The aim of treatment is to lower blood phenylalanine concentrations to the recommended therapeutic range to prevent developmental delay and support normal growth. Current treatment consists of a low-phenylalanine diet in combination with a protein substitute which is free from or low in phenylalanine. Guidance regarding the use, dosage, and distribution of dosage of the protein substitute over a 24-hour period is unclear, and there is variation in recommendations among treatment centres. This is an update of a Cochrane review first published in 2005, and previously updated in 2008.Objectives: To assess the benefits and adverse effects of protein substitute, its dosage, and distribution of dose in children and adults with phenylketonuria who are adhering to a low-phenylalanine diet.Search methods: We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group Trials Register which consists of references identified from comprehensive electronic database searches and hand searches of relevant journals and abstract books of conference proceedings. We also contacted manufacturers of the phenylalanine-free and low-phenylalanine protein substitutes for any data from published and unpublished randomised controlled trials.Date of the most recent search of the Group's Inborn Errors of Metabolism Trials Register: 03 April 2014.Selection criteria: All randomised or quasi-randomised controlled trials comparing: any dose of protein substitute with no protein substitute; an alternative dosage; or the same dose, but given as frequent small doses throughout the day compared with the same total daily dose given as larger boluses less frequently.Data collection and analysis: Both authors independently extracted data and assessed trial quality.Main results: Three trials (69 participants) are included in this review. One trial investigated the use of protein substitute in 16 participants, while a further two trials investigated the dosage of protein substitute in a total of 53 participants. Due to issues with data presentation in each trial, described in full in the review, formal statistical analyses of the data were impossible. Investigators will be contacted for further information.Authors' conclusions: No conclusions could be drawn about the short- or long-term use of protein substitute in phenylketonuria due to the lack of adequate or analysable trial data. Additional data and randomised controlled trials are needed to investigate the use of protein substitute in phenylketonuria. Until further evidence is available, current practice in the use of protein substitute should continue to be monitored with care.US: http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD004731.pub4/abstractRecord #92 of 271ID: CD011130AU: Dixit RuchitaAU: Nettem SowmyaAU: Madan Simerjit SAU: Soe Htoo Htoo KyawAU: Abas Adinegara BLAU: Vance Leah DAU: Stover Patrick JTI: Folate supplementation in people with sickle cell diseaseSO: Cochrane Database of Systematic ReviewsYR: 2016NO: 2PB: John Wiley & Sons, LtdKY: Anemia, Sickle Cell [blood] [drug therapy];Erythrocyte Indices;Folic Acid [administration & dosage] [blood];Growth;Hematinics [administration & dosage];Child[checkword];Humans[checkword]CC: CFDOI: 10.1002/14651858.CD011130.pub2AB: Background: Sickle cell disease is a group of disorders that affects haemoglobin, which causes distorted sickle- or crescent-shaped red blood cells. It is characterized by anaemia, increased susceptibility to infections and episodes of pain. The disease is acquired by inheriting abnormal genes from both parents, the combination giving rise to different forms of the disease. Due to increased erythropoiesis in people with sickle cell disease, it is hypothesized that they are at an increased risk for folate deficiency. For this reason, children and adults with sickle cell disease, particularly those with sickle cell anaemia, commonly take 1 mg of folic acid orally every day on the premise that this will replace depleted folate stores and reduce the symptoms of anaemia. It is thus important to evaluate the role of folate supplementation in treating sickle cell disease.Objectives: To analyse the efficacy and possible adverse effects of folate supplementation (folate occurring naturally in foods, provided as fortified foods or additional supplements such as tablets) in people with sickle cell disease.Search methods: We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group’s Haemoglobinopathies Trials Register comprising references identified from comprehensive electronic database searches and handsearches of relevant journals and abstract books of conference proceedings. We also conducted additional searches in both electronic databases and clinical trial registries.Date of last search: 07 December 2015.Selection criteria: Randomised, placebo-controlled trials of folate supplementation for sickle cell disease.Data collection and analysis: Four review authors assessed the eligibility and risk of bias of the included trials and extracted and analysed the data included in the review. We used the standard Cochrane-defined methodological procedures.Main results: One trial, undertaken in 1983, was eligible for inclusion in the review. This was a double-blind placebo-controlled quasi-randomised triaI of supplementation of folic acid in people with sickle cell disease. A total of 117 children with homozygous sickle cell (SS) disease aged six months to four years of age participated over a one-year period (analysis was restricted to 115 children).Serum folate measures, obtained after trial entry at six and 12 months, were available in 80 of 115 (70%) participants. There were significant differences between the folic acid and placebo groups with regards to serum folate values above 18 µg/l and values below 5 µg/l. In the folic acid group, values above 18 µg/l were observed in 33 of 41 (81 %) compared to six of 39 (15%) participants in the placebo (calcium lactate) group. Additionally, there were no participants in the folic acid group with serum folate levels below 5 µg/l, whereas in the placebo group, 15 of 39 (39%) participants had levels below this threshold. Haematological indices were measured in 100 of 115 (87%) participants at baseline and at one year. After adjusting for sex and age group, the investigators reported no significant differences between the trial groups with regards to total haemoglobin concentrations, either at baseline or at one year. It is important to note that none of the raw data for the outcomes listed above were available for analysis.The proportions of participants who experienced certain clinical events were analysed in all 115 participants, for which raw data were available. There were no statistically significant differences noted; however, the trial was not powered to investigate differences between the folic acid and placebo groups with regards to: minor infections, risk ratio 0.99 (95% confidence interval 0.85 to 1.15); major infections, risk ratio 0.89 (95% confidence interval 0.47 to 1.66); dactylitis, risk ratio 0.67 (95% confidence interval 0.35 to 1.27); acute splenic sequestration, risk ratio 1.07 (95% confidence interval 0.44 to 2.57); or episodes of pain, risk ratio 1.16 (95% confidence interval 0.70 to 1.92). However, the investigators reported a higher proportion of repeat dactylitis episodes in the placebo group, with two or more attacks occurring in 10 of 56 participants compared to two of 59 in the folic acid group (P < 0.05).Growth, determined by height-for-age and weight-for-age, as well as height and growth velocity, was measured in 103 of the 115 participants (90%), for which raw data were not available. The investigators reported no significant differences in growth between the two groups.The trial had a high risk of bias with regards to random sequence generation and incomplete outcome data. There was an unclear risk of bias in relation to allocation concealment, outcome assessment, and selective reporting. Finally, There was a low risk of bias with regards to blinding of participants and personnel. Overall the quality of the evidence in the review was low.There were no trials identified for other eligible comparisons, namely: folate supplementation (fortified foods and physical supplementation with tablets) versus placebo; folate supplementation (naturally occurring in diet) versus placebo; folate supplementation (fortified foods and physical supplementation with tablets) versus folate supplementation (naturally occurring in diet).Authors' conclusions: One doubIe-blind, placebo-controlled triaI on folic acid supplementation in children with sickle cell disease was included in the review. Overall, the trial presented mixed evidence on the review's outcomes. No trials in adults were identified. With the limited evidence provided, we conclude that, while it is possible that folic acid supplementation may increase serum folate levels, the effect of supplementation on anaemia and any symptoms of anaemia remains unclear.Further trials may add evidence regarding the efficacy of folate supplementation. Future trials should assess clinical outcomes such as folate concentration, haemoglobin concentration, adverse effects and benefits of the intervention, especially with regards to sickle cell disease-related morbidity. Trials should include people with sickle cell disease of all ages and both sexes, in any setting. To investigate the effects of folate supplementation, trials should recruit more participants and be of longer duration, with long-term follow up, than the trial currently included in this review.US: http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD011130.pub2/abstractRecord #93 of 271ID: CD009456AU: Morgan Angela TAU: Dodrill PamelaAU: Ward Elizabeth CTI: Interventions for oropharyngeal dysphagia in children with neurological impairmentSO: Cochrane Database of Systematic ReviewsYR: 2012NO: 10PB: John Wiley & Sons, LtdKY: Cerebral Palsy [complications];Deglutition;Deglutition Disorders [etiology] [therapy];Exercise Therapy [methods];Myotonic Dystrophy [complications];Child[checkword];Humans[checkword]CC: BEHAVDOI: 10.1002/14651858.CD009456.pub2AB: Background: Oropharyngeal dysphagia encompasses problems with the oral preparatory phase of swallowing (chewing and preparing the food), oral phase (moving the food or fluid posteriorly through the oral cavity with the tongue into the back of the throat) and pharyngeal phase (swallowing the food or fluid and moving it through the pharynx to the oesophagus). Populations of children with neurological impairment who commonly experience dysphagia include, but are not limited to, those with acquired brain impairment (for example, cerebral palsy, traumatic brain injury, stroke), genetic syndromes (for example, Down syndrome, Rett syndrome) and degenerative conditions (for example, myotonic dystrophy).Objectives: To examine the effectiveness of interventions for oropharyngeal dysphagia in children with neurological impairment.Search methods: We searched the following electronic databases in October 2011: CENTRAL 2011(3), MEDLINE (1948 to September Week 4 2011), EMBASE (1980 to 2011 Week 40) , CINAHL (1937 to current) , ERIC (1966 to current), PsycINFO (1806 to October Week 1 2011), Science Citation Index (1970 to 7 October 2011), Social Science Citation Index (1970 to 7 October 2011), Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, 2011(3), DARE 2011(3), Current Controlled Trials (ISRCTN Register) (15 October 2011), ClinicalTrials.gov (15 October 2011) and WHO ICTRP (15 October 2011). We searched for dissertations and theses using Networked Digital Library of Theses and Dissertations, Australasian Digital Theses Program and DART-Europe E-theses Portal (11 October 2011). Finally, additional references were also obtained from reference lists from articles.Selection criteria: The review included randomised controlled trials and quasi-randomised controlled trials for children with oropharyngeal dysphagia and neurological impairment.Data collection and analysis: All three review authors (AM, PD and EW) independently screened titles and abstracts for inclusion and discussed results. In cases of uncertainty over whether an abstract met inclusion criterion, review authors obtained the full-text article and independently evaluated each paper for inclusion. The data were categorised for comparisons depending on the nature of the control group (for example, oral sensorimotor treatment versus no treatment). Effectiveness of the oropharyngeal dysphagia intervention was assessed by considering primary outcomes of physiological functions of the oropharyngeal mechanism for swallowing (for example, lip seal maintenance), the presence of chest infection and pneumonia, and diet consistency a child is able to consume. Secondary outcomes were changes in growth, child’s level of participation in the mealtime routine and the level of parent or carer stress associated with feeding.Main results: Three studies met the inclusion criteria for the review. Two studies were based on oral sensorimotor interventions for participants with cerebral palsy compared to standard care and a third study trialled lip strengthening exercises for children with myotonic dystrophy type 1 compared to no treatment (Sjogreen 2010). A meta-analysis combining results across the three studies was not possible because one of the studies had participants with a different condition, and the remaining two, although using oral sensorimotor treatments, used vastly different approaches with different intensities and durations. The decision not to combine these was in line with our protocol. In this review, we present the results from individual studies for four outcomes: physiological functions of the oropharyngeal mechanism for swallowing, the presence of chest infection and pneumonia, diet consistency, and changes in growth. However, it is not possible to reach definitive conclusions on the effectiveness of particular interventions for oropharyngeal dysphagia based on these studies. One study had a high risk of attrition bias owing to missing data, had statistically significant differences (in weight) across experimental and control groups at baseline, and did not describe other aspects of the trial sufficiently to enable assessment of other potential risks of bias. Another study was at high risk of detection bias as some outcomes were assessed by parents who knew whether their child was in the intervention or control group. The third study overall seemed to be at low risk of bias, but like the other two studies, suffered from a small sample size.Authors' conclusions: The review demonstrates that there is currently insufficient high-quality evidence from randomised controlled trials or quasi-randomised controlled trials to provide conclusive results about the effectiveness of any particular type of oral-motor therapy for children with neurological impairment. There is an urgent need for larger-scale (appropriately statistically powered), randomised trials to evaluate the efficacy of interventions for oropharyngeal dysphagia.US: http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD009456.pub2/abstractRecord #94 of 271ID: CD007901AU: Delgado-Noguera Mario FAU: Calvache Jose AndresAU: Bonfill Cosp XavierAU: Kotanidou Eleni PAU: Galli-Tsinopoulou AssiminaTI: Supplementation with long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LCPUFA) to breastfeeding mothers for improving child growth and developmentSO: Cochrane Database of Systematic ReviewsYR: 2015NO: 7PB: John Wiley & Sons, LtdKY: Breast Feeding;Child Development;Growth;Attention;Fatty Acids, Unsaturated [administration & dosage];Intelligence;Language Development;Problem Solving;Psychomotor Performance;Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic;Visual Acuity;Female[checkword];Humans[checkword];Infant[checkword]DOI: 10.1002/14651858.CD007901.pub3AB: Background: Long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LCPUFA), especially docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), are the most abundant fatty acids in the brain and are necessary for growth and maturation of an infant's brain and retina. LCPUFAs are named “essential” because they cannot be synthesised efficiently by the human body and come from maternal diet. It remains controversial whether LCPUFA supplementation to breastfeeding mothers is beneficial for the development of their infants.Objectives: To assess the effectiveness and safety of supplementation with LCPUFA in breastfeeding mothers in the cognitive and physical development of their infants as well as safety for the mother and infant.Search methods: We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (6 August 2014), CENTRAL (Cochrane Library 2014, Issue 8), PubMed (1966 to August 2014), EMBASE (1974 to August 2014), LILACS (1982 to August 2014), Google Scholar (August 2014) and reference lists of published narrative and systematic reviews.Selection criteria: Randomised controlled trials or cluster-randomised controlled trials evaluating the effects of LCPUFA supplementation on breastfeeding mothers (including the pregnancy period) and their infants.Data collection and analysis: Two review authors independently assessed eligibility and trial quality, performed data extraction and evaluated data accuracy.Main results: We included eight randomised controlled trials involving 1567 women. All the studies were performed in high-income countries. The longest follow-up was seven years.We report the results from the longest follow-up time point from included studies. Overall, there was moderate quality evidence as assessed using the GRADE approach from these studies for the following outcomes measured beyond 24 months age of children: language development and child weight. There was low-quality evidence for the outcomes: Intelligence or solving problems ability, psychomotor development, child attention, and child visual acuity.We found no significant difference in children's neurodevelopment at long-term follow-up beyond 24 months: language development (standardised mean difference (SMD) -0.27, 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.56 to 0.02; two trials, 187 participants); intelligence or problem-solving ability (three trials, 238 participants; SMD 0.00, 95% CI -0.36 to 0.36); psychomotor development (SMD -0.11, 95% CI -0.48 to 0.26; one trial, 113 participants); motor development (SMD -0.23, 95% CI -0.60 to 0.14; one trial, 115 participants), or in general movements (risk ratio, RR, 1.12, 95% CI 0.58 to 2.14; one trial, 77 participants; at 12 weeks of life). However, child attention scores were better at five years of age in the group of children whose mothers had received supplementation with fatty acids (mean difference (MD) 4.70, 95% CI 1.30 to 8.10; one study, 110 participants)). In working memory and inhibitory control, we found no significant difference (MD -0.02 95% CI -0.07 to 0.03 one trial, 63 participants); the neurological optimality score did not present any difference (P value: 0.55).For child visual acuity, there was no significant difference (SMD 0.33, 95% CI -0.04 to 0.71; one trial, 111 participants).For growth, there were no significant differences in length (MD -0.39 cm, 95% CI -1.37 to 0.60; four trials, 441 participants), weight (MD 0.13 kg, 95% CI -0.49 to 0.74; four trials, 441 participants), and head circumference (MD 0.15 cm, 95% CI -0.27 to 0.58; three trials, 298 participants). Child fat mass and fat mass distribution did not differ between the intervention and control group (MD 2.10, 95% CI -0.48 to 4.68; one trial, 115 participants, MD -0.50, 95% CI -1.69 to 0.69; one trial, 165 participants, respectively).One study (117 infants) reported a significant difference in infant allergy at short-term follow-up (risk ratio (RR) 0.13, 95% CI 0.02 to 0.95), but not at medium-term follow-up (RR 0.52, 95% CI 0.17 to 1.59).We found no significant difference in two trials evaluating postpartum depression. Data were not possible to be pooled due to differences in the describing of the outcome. One study (89 women) did not find any significant difference between the LCPUFA supplementation and the control group at four weeks postpartum (MD 1.00, 95%CI -1.72 to 3.72).No adverse effects were reported.Authors' conclusions: Based on the available evidence, LCPUFA supplementation did not appear to improve children's neurodevelopment, visual acuity or growth. In child attention at five years of age, weak evidence was found (one study) favouring the supplementation. Currently, there is inconclusive evidence to support or refute the practice of giving LCPUFA supplementation to breastfeeding mothers in order to improve neurodevelopment or visual acuity.US: http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD007901.pub3/abstractRecord #95 of 271ID: CD004508AU: Charoenkwan KittipatAU: Matovinovic ElizabethTI: Early versus delayed oral fluids and food for reducing complications after major abdominal gynaecologic surgerySO: Cochrane Database of Systematic ReviewsYR: 2014NO: 12PB: John Wiley & Sons, LtdKY: Drinking;Eating;Gynecologic Surgical Procedures;Postoperative Care;Food;Genital Neoplasms, Female [surgery];Hysterectomy [adverse effects];Intestinal Pseudo-Obstruction [etiology];Nausea [etiology];Ovariectomy [adverse effects];Postoperative Complications [prevention & control];Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic;Recovery of Function;Time Factors;Female[checkword];Humans[checkword]CC: MENSTRDOI: 10.1002/14651858.CD004508.pub4AB: Background: This is an updated version of the original Cochrane review published in 2007. Traditionally, after major abdominal gynaecologic surgery postoperative oral intake is withheld until the return of bowel function. There has been concern that early oral intake would result in vomiting and severe paralytic ileus with subsequent aspiration pneumonia, wound dehiscence, and anastomotic leakage. However, evidence-based clinical studies suggest that there may be benefits from early postoperative oral intake.Objectives: To assess the effects of early versus delayed (traditional) initiation of oral intake of food and fluids after major abdominal gynaecologic surgery.Search methods: We searched the Menstrual Disorders and Subfertility Group's Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), electronic databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL), and the citation lists of relevant publications. The most recent search was conducted 1 April 2014. We also searched a registry for ongoing trials (www.clinicaltrials.gov) on 13 May 2014.Selection criteria: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) were eligible that compared the effect of early versus delayed initiation of oral intake of food and fluids after major abdominal gynaecologic surgery. Early feeding was defined as oral intake of fluids or food within 24 hours post-surgery regardless of the return of bowel function. Delayed feeding was defined as oral intake after 24 hours post-surgery and only after signs of postoperative ileus resolution.Data collection and analysis: Two review authors selected studies, assessed study quality and extracted the data. For dichotomous data, we calculated the risk ratio (RR) with a 95% confidence interval (CI). We examined continuous data using the mean difference (MD) and a 95% CI. We tested for heterogeneity between the results of different studies using a forest plot of the meta-analysis, the statistical tests of homogeneity of 2 x 2 tables and the I² value. We assessed the quality of the evidence using GRADE methods.Main results: Rates of developing postoperative ileus were comparable between study groups (RR 0.47, 95% CI 0.17 to 1.29, P = 0.14, 3 RCTs, 279 women, I² = 0%, moderate-quality evidence). When we considered the rates of nausea or vomiting or both, there was no evidence of a difference between the study groups (RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.64 to 1.67, P = 0.90, 4 RCTs, 484 women, I² = 73%, moderate-quality evidence). There was no evidence of a difference between the study groups in abdominal distension (RR 1.07, 95% CI 0.77 to 1.47, 2 RCTs, 301 women, I² = 0%) or a need for postoperative nasogastric tube placement (RR 0.48, 95% CI 0.13 to 1.80, 1 RCT, 195 women).  Early feeding was associated with shorter time to the presence of bowel sound (MD -0.32 days, 95% CI -0.61 to -0.03, P = 0.03, 2 RCTs, 338 women, I² = 52%, moderate-quality evidence) and faster onset of flatus (MD -0.21 days, 95% CI -0.40 to -0.01, P = 0.04, 3 RCTs, 444 women, I² = 23%, moderate-quality evidence). In addition, women in the early feeding group resumed a solid diet sooner (MD -1.47 days, 95% CI -2.26 to -0.68, P = 0.0003, 2 RCTs, 301 women, I² = 92%, moderate-quality evidence). There was no evidence of a difference in time to the first passage of stool between the two study groups (MD -0.25 days, 95% CI -0.58 to 0.09, P = 0.15, 2 RCTs, 249 women, I² = 0%, moderate-quality evidence). Hospital stay was shorter in the early feeding group (MD -0.92 days, 95% CI -1.53 to -0.31, P = 0.003, 4 RCTs, 484 women, I² = 68%, moderate-quality evidence). Infectious complications were less common in the early feeding group (RR 0.20, 95% CI 0.05 to 0.73, P = 0.02, 2 RCTs, 183 women, I² = 0%, high-quality evidence). In one study, the satisfaction score was significantly higher in the early feeding group (MD 11.10, 95% CI 6.68 to 15.52, P < 0.00001, 143 women, moderate-quality evidence).Authors' conclusions: Early postoperative feeding after major abdominal gynaecologic surgery for either benign or malignant conditions appeared to be safe without increased gastrointestinal morbidities or other postoperative complications. The benefits of this approach include faster recovery of bowel function, lower rates of infectious complications, shorter hospital stay, and higher satisfaction.US: http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD004508.pub4/abstractRecord #96 of 271ID: CD012439AU: Wolfenden LukeAU: Regan TimAU: Williams Christopher MAU: Wiggers JohnAU: Kingsland MelanieAU: Milat AndrewAU: Rissel ChrisAU: Bauman AdrianAU: Booth DebbieAU: Farrell Margaret MAU: Légaré FranceAU: Zomahoun Hervé Tchala VignonAU: Parmenter BenjaminAU: Ben Charif AliAU: Yoong Sze LinTI: Strategies to improve the implementation of workplace-based policies or practices targeting tobacco, alcohol, diet, physical activity and obesitySO: Cochrane Database of Systematic ReviewsYR: 2016NO: 12PB: John Wiley & Sons, LtdDOI: 10.1002/14651858.CD012439AB: This is a protocol for a Cochrane Review (Intervention).

Tight control of BP in diabetics lowers the risk of strokes, heart attacks and heart failure and slows the progression of diabetic kidney disease (DKD). Currently there is no consensus in restricting salt intake in diabetic patients.Objectives: To evaluate the effect of altered salt intake on BP and markers of cardiovascular disease and DKD.Search methods: In January 2010, we searched the Cochrane Renal Group's Specialised Register, CENTRAL (in The Cochrane Library), MEDLINE (from 1966) and EMBASE (from 1980) to identify appropriate articles.Selection criteria: We included all randomised controlled trials of salt reduction in individuals with type 1 and type 2 diabetes.Data collection and analysis: Two authors independently assessed studies and resolved differences by discussion with a third independent author. We calculated mean effect sizes using both the fixed-effect and random-effects models.Main results: Thirteen studies (254 individuals) met our inclusion criteria. These included 75 individuals with type 1 diabetes and 158 individuals with type 2 diabetes. The median reduction in urinary sodium was 203 mmol/24 h (11.9 g/day) in type 1 diabetes and 125 mmol/24 h (7.3 g/day) in type 2 diabetes. The median duration of salt restriction was one week in both type 1 and type 2 diabetes. BP was reduced in both type 1 and type 2 diabetes. In type 1 diabetes (56 individuals), salt restriction reduced BP by -7.11/-3.13 mm Hg (systolic/diastolic); 95% CI: systolic BP (SBP) -9.13 to -5.10; diastolic BP (DBP) -4.28 to -1.98). In type 2 diabetes (56 individuals), salt restriction reduced BP by -6.90/-2.87 mm Hg (95% CI: SBP -9.84 to -3.95; DBP -4.39 to -1.35). There was a greater reduction in BP in normotensive patients, possibly due to a larger decrease in salt intake in this group.Authors' conclusions: Although the studies are not extensive, this meta-analysis shows a large fall in BP with salt restriction, similar to that of single drug therapy. All diabetics should consider reducing salt intake at least to less than 5-6 g/day in keeping with current recommendations for the general population and may consider lowering salt intake to lower levels, although further studies are needed.US: http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD006763.pub2/abstractRecord #98 of 271ID: CD003216AU: Langer GeroAU: Fink AstridTI: Nutritional interventions for preventing and treating pressure ulcersSO: Cochrane Database of Systematic ReviewsYR: 2014NO: 6PB: John Wiley & Sons, LtdKY: Dietary Supplements;Enteral Nutrition;Parenteral Nutrition;Pressure Ulcer [prevention & control] [therapy];Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic;Wound Healing;Aged[checkword];Humans[checkword]DOI: 10.1002/14651858.CD003216.pub2AB: Background: Pressure ulcers affect approximately 10% of people in hospitals and older people are at highest risk. A correlation between inadequate nutritional intake and the development of pressure ulcers has been suggested by several studies, but the results have been inconsistent.Objectives: To evaluate the effects of enteral and parenteral nutrition on the prevention and treatment of pressure ulcers.Search methods: In March 2014, for this first update, we searched The Cochrane Wounds Group Specialised Trials Register, the Cochrane Central register of Controlled Trials (The Cochrane Library), the Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects (DARE) (The Cochrane Library), the Health Technology Assessment Database (HTA) (The Cochrane Library), the Cochrane Methodology Register (The Cochrane Library), NHS Economic Evaluation Database (The Cochrane Library), Ovid Medline, Ovid Embase and EBSCO CINAHL. No date, language or publication status limits were applied.Selection criteria: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating the effects of enteral or parenteral nutrition on the prevention and treatment of pressure ulcers, which measured the incidence of new ulcers, ulcer healing or changes in pressure ulcer severity. There were no restrictions on types of patient, setting, date, publication status or language.Data collection and analysis: Two review authors independently screened for inclusion, and disagreement was resolved by discussion. Two review authors independently extracted data and assessed quality using the Cochrane Collaboration tool for assessing risk of bias.Main results: We included 23 RCTs, many were small (between 9 and 4023 participants, median 88) and at high risk of bias.Eleven trials compared a combination of nutritional supplements, consisting of a minimum of energy and protein in different dosages, for the prevention of pressure ulcers. A meta-analysis of eight trials (6062 participants) that compared the effects of mixed nutritional supplements with standard hospital diet found no clear evidence of an effect of supplementation on pressure ulcer development (pooled RR 0.86; 95% CI 0.73 to 1.00; P value 0.05; I2 = 13%, random effects). This outcome is at unclear or high risk of bias.Fourteen trials evaluated the effects of nutritional supplements on the healing of existing pressure ulcers: seven trials examined mixed nutritional supplements, three the effects of proteins, two trials examined zinc, and two studies examined ascorbic acid. The included trials were heterogeneous with regard to participants, interventions, comparisons and outcomes and meta-analysis was not appropriate. There was no clear evidence of an improvement in pressure ulcer healing from the nutritional supplements evaluated in any of these individual studies.Authors' conclusions: There is currently no clear evidence of a benefit associated with nutritional interventions for either the prevention or treatment of pressure ulcers. Further trials of high methodological quality are necessary.US: http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD003216.pub2/abstractRecord #99 of 271ID: CD011045AU: Hollands Gareth JAU: Shemilt IanAU: Marteau Theresa MAU: Jebb Susan AAU: Lewis Hannah BAU: Wei YinghuiAU: Higgins JulianAU: Ogilvie DavidTI: Portion, package or tableware size for changing selection and consumption of food, alcohol and tobaccoSO: Cochrane Database of Systematic ReviewsYR: 2015NO: 9PB: John Wiley & Sons, LtdKY: Alcohol Drinking;Eating;Food Preferences;Smoking;Beverages [statistics & numerical data];Cooking and Eating Utensils [standards];Drinking Behavior;Portion Size [standards];Product Packaging [standards];Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic;Adult[checkword];Child[checkword];Humans[checkword]DOI: 10.1002/14651858.CD011045.pub2AB: Background: Overeating and harmful alcohol and tobacco use have been linked to the aetiology of various non-communicable diseases, which are among the leading global causes of morbidity and premature mortality. As people are repeatedly exposed to varying sizes and shapes of food, alcohol and tobacco products in environments such as shops, restaurants, bars and homes, this has stimulated public health policy interest in product size and shape as potential targets for intervention.Objectives: 1) To assess the effects of interventions involving exposure to different sizes or sets of physical dimensions of a portion, package, individual unit or item of tableware on unregulated selection or consumption of food, alcohol or tobacco products in adults and children.2) To assess the extent to which these effects may be modified by study, intervention and participant characteristics.Search methods: We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, eight other published or grey literature databases, trial registries and key websites up to November 2012, followed by citation searches and contacts with study authors. This original search identified eligible studies published up to July 2013, which are fully incorporated into the review. We conducted an updated search up to 30 January 2015 but further eligible studies are not yet fully incorporated due to their minimal potential to change the conclusions.Selection criteria: Randomised controlled trials with between-subjects (parallel-group) or within-subjects (cross-over) designs, conducted in laboratory or field settings, in adults or children. Eligible studies compared at least two groups of participants, each exposed to a different size or shape of a portion of a food (including non-alcoholic beverages), alcohol or tobacco product, its package or individual unit size, or of an item of tableware used to consume it, and included a measure of unregulated selection or consumption of food, alcohol or tobacco.Data collection and analysis: We applied standard Cochrane methods to select eligible studies for inclusion and to collect data and assess risk of bias. We calculated study-level effect sizes as standardised mean differences (SMDs) between comparison groups, measured as quantities selected or consumed. We combined these results using random-effects meta-analysis models to estimate summary effect sizes (SMDs with 95% confidence intervals (CIs)) for each outcome for size and shape comparisons. We rated the overall quality of evidence using the GRADE system. Finally, we used meta-regression analysis to investigate statistical associations between summary effect sizes and variant study, intervention or participant characteristics.Main results: The current version of this review includes 72 studies, published between 1978 and July 2013, assessed as being at overall unclear or high risk of bias with respect to selection and consumption outcomes. Ninety-six per cent of included studies (69/72) manipulated food products and 4% (3/72) manipulated cigarettes. No included studies manipulated alcohol products. Forty-nine per cent (35/72) manipulated portion size, 14% (10/72) package size and 21% (15/72) tableware size or shape. More studies investigated effects among adults (76% (55/72)) than children and all studies were conducted in high-income countries - predominantly in the USA (81% (58/72)). Sources of funding were reported for the majority of studies, with no evidence of funding by agencies with possible commercial interests in their results.A meta-analysis of 86 independent comparisons from 58 studies (6603 participants) found a small to moderate effect of portion, package, individual unit or tableware size on consumption of food (SMD 0.38, 95% CI 0.29 to 0.46), providing moderate quality evidence that exposure to larger sizes increased quantities of food consumed among children (SMD 0.21, 95% CI 0.10 to 0.31) and adults (SMD 0.46, 95% CI 0.40 to 0.52). The size of this effect suggests that, if sustained reductions in exposure to larger-sized food portions, packages and tableware could be achieved across the whole diet, this could reduce average daily energy consumed from food by between 144 and 228 kcal (8.5% to 13.5% from a baseline of 1689 kcal) among UK children and adults. A meta-analysis of six independent comparisons from three studies (108 participants) found low quality evidence for no difference in the effect of cigarette length on consumption (SMD 0.25, 95% CI -0.14 to 0.65).One included study (50 participants) estimated a large effect on consumption of exposure to differently shaped tableware (SMD 1.17, 95% CI 0.57 to 1.78), rated as very low quality evidence that exposure to shorter, wider bottles (versus taller, narrower bottles) increased quantities of water consumed by young adult participants.A meta-analysis of 13 independent comparisons from 10 studies (1164 participants) found a small to moderate effect of portion or tableware size on selection of food (SMD 0.42, 95% CI 0.24 to 0.59), rated as moderate quality evidence that exposure to larger sizes increased the quantities of food people selected for subsequent consumption. This effect was present among adults (SMD 0.55, 95% CI 0.35 to 0.75) but not children (SMD 0.14, 95% CI -0.06 to 0.34).In addition, a meta-analysis of three independent comparisons from three studies (232 participants) found a very large effect of exposure to differently shaped tableware on selection of non-alcoholic beverages (SMD 1.47, 95% CI 0.52 to 2.43), rated as low quality evidence that exposure to shorter, wider (versus taller, narrower) glasses or bottles increased the quantities selected for subsequent consumption among adults (SMD 2.31, 95% CI 1.79 to 2.83) and children (SMD 1.03, 95% CI 0.41 to 1.65).Authors' conclusions: This review found that people consistently consume more food and drink when offered larger-sized portions, packages or tableware than when offered smaller-sized versions. This suggests that policies and practices that successfully reduce the size, availability and appeal of larger-sized portions, packages, individual units and tableware can contribute to meaningful reductions in the quantities of food (including non-alcoholic beverages) people select and consume in the immediate and short term. However, it is uncertain whether reducing portions at the smaller end of the size range can be as effective in reducing food consumption as reductions at the larger end of the range. We are unable to highlight clear implications for tobacco or alcohol policy due to identified gaps in the current evidence base.US: http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD011045.pub2/abstractRecord #100 of 271ID: CD005230AU: Huang TaoAU: Shu XuAU: Huang Yu ShanAU: Cheuk Daniel KLTI: Complementary and miscellaneous interventions for nocturnal enuresis in childrenSO: Cochrane Database of Systematic ReviewsYR: 2011NO: 12PB: John Wiley & Sons, LtdKY: Psychotherapy;Acupuncture Therapy;Complementary Therapies [methods];Counseling;Deamino Arginine Vasopressin [therapeutic use];Electric Stimulation Therapy;Homeopathy;Hypnosis;Manipulation, Chiropractic;Nocturnal Enuresis [therapy];Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic;Renal Agents [therapeutic use];Child[checkword];Humans[checkword]CC: INCONTDOI: 10.1002/14651858.CD005230.pub2AB: Background: Nocturnal enuresis (bedwetting) is a socially disruptive and stressful condition which affects around 15% to 20% of five year olds, and up to 2% of young adults.Objectives: To assess the effects of complementary interventions and others such as surgery or diet on nocturnal enuresis in children, and to compare them with other interventions.Search methods: We searched PubMed (1950 to June 2010), EMBASE (1980 to June 2010), the Traditional Chinese Medical Literature Analysis and Retrieval System (TCMLARS) (1984 to June 2010), Chinese Biomedical Literature Database (CBM) (1975 to June 2010), China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) (1979 to June 2010), VIP database (1989 to June 2010), and the reference lists of relevant articles, all last searched 26 June 2010. No language restriction was used.Selection criteria: All randomised or quasi-randomised trials of complementary and other miscellaneous interventions for nocturnal enuresis in children were included except those focused solely on daytime wetting. Comparison interventions could include no treatment, placebo or sham treatment, alarms, simple behavioural treatment, desmopressin, imipramine and miscellaneous other drugs and interventions.Data collection and analysis: Two reviewers independently assessed the quality of the eligible trials, and extracted data.Main results: In 24 randomised controlled trials, 2334 children were studied, of whom 1283 received a complementary intervention. The quality of the trials was poor: 5 trials were quasi-randomised, 5 showed differences at baseline and 17 lacked follow up data.The outcome was better after hypnosis than imipramine in one trial (relative risk (RR) for failure or relapse after stopping treatment 0.42, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.23 to 0.78). Psychotherapy appeared to be better in terms of fewer children failing or relapsing than both alarm (RR 0.28, 95% CI 0.09 to 0.85) and rewards (RR 0.29, 95%CI 0.09 to 0.90) but this depended on data from only one trial. Medicinal herbs had better results than desmopressin in one trial (RR for failure or relapse after stopping treatment 0.35, 95% CI 0.14 to 0.85). Acupuncture had better results than sham control acupuncture (RR for failure or relapse after stopping treatment 0.67, 95% CI 0.48 to 0.94) in a further trial. Active chiropractic adjustment had better results than sham adjustment (RR for failure to improve 0.76, 95% CI 0.60 to 0.95). However, each of these findings came from small single trials, and must be verified in further trials. The findings for diet and faradization were unreliable, and there were no trials including homeopathy or surgery.Authors' conclusions: There was weak evidence to support the use of hypnosis, psychotherapy, acupuncture, chiropractic and medicinal herbs but it was provided in each case by single small trials, some of dubious methodological rigour. Robust randomised trials are required with efficacy, cost-effectiveness and adverse effects clearly reported.US: http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD005230.pub2/abstractRecord #101 of 271ID: CD005414AU: Bath-Hextall Fiona JAU: Leonardi-Bee JoAU: Somchand NealAU: Webster Angela CAU: Dellit JimAU: Perkins WilliamTI: Interventions for preventing non-melanoma skin cancers in high-risk groupsSO: Cochrane Database of Systematic ReviewsYR: 2007NO: 4PB: John Wiley & Sons, LtdKY: Carcinoma, Basal Cell [etiology] [prevention & control];Carcinoma, Squamous Cell [etiology] [prevention & control];Neoplasms, Radiation-Induced [prevention & control];Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic;Risk Factors;Skin Neoplasms [etiology] [prevention & control];Sunlight [adverse effects];Humans[checkword]CC: SKINDOI: 10.1002/14651858.CD005414.pub2AB: Background: Some groups of people have a greater risk of developing common non-melanoma skin cancers (NMSC).Objectives: To evaluate interventions for preventing NMSC in people at high risk of developing NMSC.Search methods: We searched the Cochrane Skin Group Specialised Register (March 2007), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (The Cochrane Library Issue 1, 2007, MEDLINE (from 2003 to March 2007), EMBASE (from 2005 to March 2007), the metaRegister of Controlled Trials (February 2007). References from trials and reviews were also searched. Pharmaceutical companies were contacted for unpublished trials.Selection criteria: Randomised controlled trials of adults and children at high risk of developing NMSC.Data collection and analysis: Two review authors independently selected studies and assessed their methodological quality.Main results: We identified 10 trials (7,229 participants) that assessed a variety of interventions.One trial found T4N5 liposome lotion significantly reduced the rate of appearance of new BCCs in people with xeroderma pigmentosum.One of three trials of renal transplant recipients showed a significantly reduced risk of new NMSCs when acitretin was compared to placebo (relative risk (RR) 0.22 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.06 to 0.90) and no significant difference in risk of adverse events in two trials (RR 1.80, 95% CI 0.70 to 4.61).In three trials conducted in people with a history of NMSC, the evidence was inconclusive for the development of BCCs for retinol or isoretinoin. However the risk of a new SCC in one trial (HR 1.79, 95% CI 1.16 to 2.76) and adverse events in another trial (RR 1.76, 95% CI 1.57 to 1.97) were significantly increased in the isotretinoin group compared with placebo.In one trial selenium showed a reduced risk of other types of cancer compared with placebo (RR 0.65, 95% CI 0.50 to 0.85) but also a significantly elevated risk of a new NMSC (HR 1.17, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.34). The evidence for one trial of beta-carotene was inconclusive; and there was a trend towards fewer new NMSC in a trial of a reduced fat diet (RR 0.16, 95% CI 0.02 to 1.31), p = 0.09.Authors' conclusions: Some preventative treatments may benefit people at high risk of developing NMSC, but the ability to draw firm conclusions is limited by small numbers of trials, often with one trial per intervention or with inconsistent results between studies.US: http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD005414.pub2/abstractRecord #102 of 271ID: CD004905AU: Haider Batool AAU: Bhutta Zulfiqar ATI: Multiple-micronutrient supplementation for women during pregnancySO: Cochrane Database of Systematic ReviewsYR: 2015NO: 11PB: John Wiley & Sons, LtdKY: Dietary Supplements;Drug Interactions;Folic Acid [administration & dosage];Iron, Dietary [administration & dosage];Micronutrients [administration & dosage] [adverse effects] [deficiency];Pregnancy Complications [therapy];Pregnancy Outcome;Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic;Female[checkword];Humans[checkword];Pregnancy[checkword]DOI: 10.1002/14651858.CD004905.pub4AB: Background: Multiple-micronutrient (MMN) deficiencies often coexist among women of reproductive age in low- to middle-income countries. They are exacerbated in pregnancy due to the increased demands, leading to potentially adverse effects on the mother and developing fetus. Though supplementation with MMNs has been recommended earlier because of the evidence of impact on pregnancy outcomes, a consensus is yet to be reached regarding the replacement of iron and folic acid supplementation with MMNs. Since the last update of this Cochrane review, evidence from a few large trials has recently been made available, the inclusion of which is critical to inform policy.Objectives: To evaluate the benefits of oral multiple-micronutrient supplementation during pregnancy on maternal, fetal and infant health outcomes.Search methods: We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (11 March 2015) and reference lists of retrieved articles and key reviews. We also contacted experts in the field for additional and ongoing trials.Selection criteria: All prospective randomised controlled trials evaluating MMN supplementation with iron and folic acid during pregnancy and its effects on the pregnancy outcome were eligible, irrespective of language or the publication status of the trials. We included cluster-randomised trials, but quasi-randomised trials were excluded.Data collection and analysis: Two review authors independently assessed trials for inclusion and risk of bias, extracted data and checked them for accuracy. The quality of the evidence was assessed using the GRADE approach.Main results: Nineteen trials (involving 138,538 women) were identified as eligible for inclusion in this review but only 17 trials (involving 137,791 women) contributed data to the review. Fifteen of these 17 trials were carried out in low and middle-income countries and compared MMN supplements with iron and folic acid versus iron with or without folic acid. Two trials carried out in the UK compared MMN with a placebo. MMN with iron and folic acid versus iron, with or without folic acid (15 trials): MMN resulted in a significant decrease in the number of newborn infants identified as low birthweight (LBW) (average risk ratio (RR) 0.88, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.85 to 0.91; high-quality evidence) or small-for-gestational age (SGA) (average RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.86 to 0.98; moderate-quality evidence). No significant differences were shown for other maternal and pregnancy outcomes: preterm births (average RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.90 to 1.03; high-quality evidence), stillbirth (average RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.87, 1.09; high-quality evidence), maternal anaemia in the third trimester (average RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.24), miscarriage (average RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.80 to 1.03), maternal mortality (average RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.63 to 1.48), perinatal mortality (average RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.13; high-quality evidence), neonatal mortality (average RR 1.06, 95% CI 0.92 to 1.22; high-quality evidence), or risk of delivery via a caesarean section (average RR 1.04; 95% CI 0.74 to 1.46).A number of prespecified, clinically important outcomes could not be assessed due to insufficient or non-available data. Single trials reported results for: very preterm birth < 34 weeks, macrosomia, side-effects of supplements, nutritional status of children, and congenital anomalies including neural tube defects and neurodevelopmental outcome: Bayley Scales of Infant Development (BSID) scores. None of these trials reported pre-eclampsia, placental abruption, premature rupture of membranes, cost of supplementation, and maternal well-being or satisfaction.When assessed according to GRADE criteria, the quality of evidence for the review's primary outcomes overall was good. Pooled results for primary outcomes were based on multiple trials with large sample sizes and precise estimates. The following outcomes were graded to be as of high quality: preterm birth, LBW, perinatal mortality, stillbirth and neonatal mortality. The outcome of SGA was graded to be of moderate quality, with evidence downgraded by one for funnel plot asymmetry and potential publication bias.We carried out sensitivity analysis excluding trials with high levels of sample attrition (> 20%); results were consistent with the main analysis except for the findings for SGA (average RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.84 to 1.00). We explored heterogeneity through subgroup analyses by maternal height and body mass index (BMI), timing of supplementation and dose of iron. Subgroup differences were observed for maternal BMI for the outcome preterm birth, with significant findings among women with low BMI. Subgroup differences were also observed for maternal BMI and maternal height for the outcome SGA, indicating a significant impact among women with higher maternal BMI and height. The overall analysis of perinatal mortality, although showed a non-significant effect of MMN supplements versus iron with or without folic acid, was found to have substantial statistical heterogeneity. Subgroup differences were observed for timing of supplementation for this outcome, indicating a significantly higher impact with late initiation of supplementation. The findings between subgroups for other primary outcomes were inconclusive. MMN versus placebo (two trials): A single trial in the UK found no clear differences between groups for preterm birth, SGA, LBW or maternal anaemia in the third trimester. A second trial reported the number of women with pre-eclampsia; there was no evidence of a difference between groups. Other outcomes were not reported.Authors' conclusions: Our findings support the effect of MMN supplements with iron and folic acid in improving some birth outcomes. Overall, pregnant women who received MMN supplementation had fewer low birthweight babies and small-for-gestational-age babies. The findings, consistently observed in several systematic evaluations of evidence, provide a basis to guide the replacement of iron and folic acid with MMN supplements containing iron and folic acid for pregnant women in low and middle-income countries where MMN deficiencies are common among women of reproductive age. Efforts could focus on the integration of this intervention in maternal nutrition and antenatal care programs in low and middle-income countries.US: http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD004905.pub4/abstractRecord #103 of 271ID: CD004204AU: Simmer KarenAU: Askie Lisa MTI: Preterm formula milk versus term formula milk for feeding preterm or low birth weight infantsSO: Cochrane Database of Systematic ReviewsYR: 2003NO: 2PB: John Wiley & Sons, LtdCC: NEONATALDOI: 10.1002/14651858.CD004204AB: This is the protocol for a review and there is no abstract.

In separate comparisons, we will examine the effect of preterm vs term formula fed as sole diet, as supplement to human milk, or as either sole diet or supplement to human milk.As the factors noted below may impact significantly on treatment effects, the following subgroup analyses will be performed:   - birth weight category (extremely LBW, less than or equal to 1000g) (as very small infants are at higher risk of adverse outcomes)   - gestational age (less than 28 weeks) (as very low gestation infants are at higher risk of adverse outcomes)   - male infants (outcomes for males are different from females)   - trials with longer duration of the intervention, i.e. trials continuing the intervention post-discharge from hospital (as preterm infants may not receive their recommended dietary intakes while still in hospital)   - in utero growth retardation (small and appropriate for gestational age infants may have different nutritional requirements. Studies indicating very low birth weight infants will have a higher percentage of small for gestational age infants than the normal populations.)US: http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD004204/abstractRecord #104 of 271ID: CD000032AU: Ota ErikaAU: Hori HiroyukiAU: Mori RintaroAU: Tobe-Gai RuoyanAU: Farrar DianeTI: Antenatal dietary education and supplementation to increase energy and protein intakeSO: Cochrane Database of Systematic ReviewsYR: 2015NO: 6PB: John Wiley & Sons, LtdKY: Energy Intake;Diet [methods];Dietary Proteins [administration & dosage];Dietary Supplements;Fetal Development;Pregnancy Outcome;Premature Birth [prevention & control];Prenatal Care [methods];Prenatal Education [methods];Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic;Stillbirth;Weight Gain;Female[checkword];Humans[checkword];Pregnancy[checkword]CC: PREGDOI: 10.1002/14651858.CD000032.pub3AB: Background: Gestational weight gain is positively associated with fetal growth, and observational studies of food supplementation in pregnancy have reported increases in gestational weight gain and fetal growth.Objectives: To assess the effects of education during pregnancy to increase energy and protein intake, or of actual energy and protein supplementation, on energy and protein intake, and the effect on maternal and infant health outcomes.Search methods: We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (31 January 2015), reference lists of retrieved studies and contacted researchers in the field.Selection criteria: Randomised controlled trials of dietary education to increase energy and protein intake, or of actual energy and protein supplementation, during pregnancy.Data collection and analysis: Two review authors independently assessed trials for inclusion and assessed risk of bias. Two review authors independently extracted data and checked for accuracy. Extracted data were supplemented by additional information from the trialists we contacted.Main results: We examined 149 reports corresponding to 65 trials. Of these trials, 17 were included, 46 were excluded, and two are ongoing. Overall, 17 trials involving 9030 women were included. For this update, we assessed methodological quality of the included trials using the standard Cochrane criteria (risk of bias) and the GRADE approach. The overall risk of bias was unclear. Nutritional education (five trials, 1090 women)Women given nutritional education had a lower relative risk of having a preterm birth (two trials, 449 women) (risk ratio (RR) 0.46, 95% CI 0.21 to 0.98, low-quality evidence), and low birthweight (one trial, 300 women) (RR 0.04, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.14). Head circumference at birth was increased in one trial (389 women) (mean difference (MD) 0.99 cm, 95% CI 0.43 to 1.55), while birthweight was significantly increased among undernourished women in two trials (320 women) (MD 489.76 g, 95% CI 427.93 to 551.59, low-quality evidence), but did not significantly increase for adequately nourished women (MD 15.00, 95% CI -76.30 to 106.30, one trial, 406 women). Protein intake increased significantly (three trials, 632 women) (protein intake: MD +6.99 g/day, 95% CI 3.02 to 10.97). No significant differences were observed on any other outcomes such as neonatal death (RR 1.28, 95% CI 0.35 to 4.72, one trial, 448 women, low-quality evidence), stillbirth (RR 0.37, 95% CI 0.07 to 1.90, one trial, 431 women, low-quality evidence), small-for-gestational age (RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.45 to 2.11, one trial, 404 women, low-quality evidence) and total gestational weight gain (MD -0.41, 95% CI -4.41 to 3.59, two trials, 233 women). There were no data on perinatal death. Balanced energy and protein supplementation (12 trials, 6705 women)Risk of stillbirth was significantly reduced for women given balanced energy and protein supplementation (RR 0.60, 95% CI 0.39 to 0.94, five trials, 3408 women, moderate-quality evidence), and the mean birthweight was significantly increased (random-effects MD +40.96 g, 95% CI 4.66 to 77.26, Tau² = 1744, I² = 44%, 11 trials, 5385 women, moderate-quality evidence). There was also a significant reduction in the risk of small-for-gestational age (RR 0.79, 95% CI 0.69 to 0.90, I² = 16%, seven trials, 4408 women, moderate-quality evidence). No significant effect was detected for preterm birth (RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.80 to 1.16, five trials, 3384 women, moderate-quality evidence) or neonatal death (RR 0.68, 95% CI 0.43 to 1.07, five trials, 3381 women, low-quality evidence). Weekly gestational weight gain was not significantly increased (MD 18.63, 95% CI -1.81 to 39.07, nine trials, 2391 women, very low quality evidence). There were no data reported on perinatal death and low birthweight. High-protein supplementation (one trial, 1051 women)High-protein supplementation (one trial, 505 women), was associated with a significantly increased risk of small-for-gestational age babies (RR 1.58, 95% CI 1.03 to 2.41, moderate-quality evidence). There was no significant effect for stillbirth (RR 0.81, 95% CI 0.31 to 2.15, one trial, 529 women), neonatal death (RR 2.78, 95% CI 0.75 to 10.36, one trial, 529 women), preterm birth (RR 1.14, 95% CI 0.83 to 1.56, one trial, 505 women), birthweight (MD -73.00, 95% CI -171.26 to 25.26, one trial, 504 women) and weekly gestational weight gain (MD 4.50, 95% CI -33.55 to 42.55, one trial, 486 women, low-quality evidence). No data were reported on perinatal death. Isocaloric protein supplementation (two trials, 184 women)Isocaloric protein supplementation (two trials, 184 women) had no significant effect on birthweight (MD 108.25, 95% CI -220.89 to 437.40) and weekly gestational weight gain (MD 110.45, 95% CI -82.87 to 303.76, very low-quality evidence). No data reported on perinatal mortality, stillbirth, neonatal death, small-for-gestational age, and preterm birth.Authors' conclusions: This review provides encouraging evidence that antenatal nutritional education with the aim of increasing energy and protein intake in the general obstetric population appears to be effective in reducing the risk of preterm birth, low birthweight, increasing head circumference at birth, increasing birthweight among undernourished women, and increasing protein intake. There was no evidence of benefit or adverse effect for any other outcome reported.Balanced energy and protein supplementation seems to improve fetal growth, and may reduce the risk of stillbirth and infants born small-for-gestational age. High-protein supplementation does not seem to be beneficial and may be harmful to the fetus. Balanced-protein supplementation alone had no significant effects on perinatal outcomes.The results of this review should be interpreted with caution. The risk of bias was either unclear or high for at least one category examined in several of the included trials, and the quality of the evidence was low for several important outcomes. Also, as the anthropometric characteristics of the general obstetric population is changing, those developing interventions aimed at altering energy and protein intake should ensure that only those women likely to benefit are included. Large, well-designed randomised trials are needed to assess the effects of increasing energy and protein intake during pregnancy in women whose intake is below recommended levels.US: http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD000032.pub3/abstractRecord #105 of 271ID: CD009547AU: Pearsall RobertAU: Thyarappa Praveen KudlarAU: Pelosi AnthonyAU: Geddes JohnTI: Dietary advice for people with schizophreniaSO: Cochrane Database of Systematic ReviewsYR: 2016NO: 3PB: John Wiley & Sons, LtdKY: Counseling;Diet;Life Style;Schizophrenia;Humans[checkword]DOI: 10.1002/14651858.CD009547.pub2AB: Background: People with serious mental illness have consistently higher levels of mortality and morbidity than the general population.

Higher selenium exposure and selenium supplements have been suggested to protect against several types of cancers.Objectives: Two research questions were addressed in this review: What is the evidence for:1. an aetiological relation between selenium exposure and cancer risk in humans? and  2. the efficacy of selenium supplementation for cancer prevention in humans?Search methods: We conducted electronic searches of the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, 2013, Issue 1), MEDLINE (Ovid, 1966 to February 2013 week 1), EMBASE (1980 to 2013 week 6), CancerLit (February 2004) and CCMed (February 2011). As MEDLINE now includes the journals indexed in CancerLit, no further searches were conducted in this database after 2004.Selection criteria: We included prospective observational studies (cohort studies including sub-cohort controlled studies and nested case-control studies) and randomised controlled trials (RCTs) with healthy adult participants (18 years of age and older).Data collection and analysis: For observational studies, we conducted random effects meta-analyses when five or more studies were retrieved for a specific outcome. For RCTs, we performed random effects meta-analyses when two or more studies were available. The risk of bias in observational studies was assessed using forms adapted from the Newcastle-Ottawa Quality Assessment Scale for cohort and case-control studies; the criteria specified in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions were used to evaluate the risk of bias in RCTs.Main results: We included 55 prospective observational studies (including more than 1,100,000 participants) and eight RCTs (with a total of 44,743 participants). For the observational studies, we found lower cancer incidence (summary odds ratio (OR) 0.69, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.53 to 0.91, N = 8) and cancer mortality (OR 0.60, 95% CI 0.39 to 0.93, N = 6) associated with higher selenium exposure. Gender-specific subgroup analysis provided no clear evidence of different effects in men and women (P value 0.47), although cancer incidence was lower in men (OR 0.66, 95% CI 0.42 to 1.05, N = 6) than in women (OR 0.90, 95% CI 0.45 to 1.77, N = 2). The most pronounced decreases in risk of site-specific cancers were seen for stomach, bladder and prostate cancers. However, these findings have limitations due to study design, quality and heterogeneity that complicate interpretation of the summary statistics. Some studies suggested that genetic factors may modify the relation between selenium and cancer risk-a hypothesis that deserves further investigation.In RCTs, we found no clear evidence that selenium supplementation reduced the risk of any cancer (risk ratio (RR) 0.90, 95% CI 0.70 to 1.17, two studies, N = 4765) or cancer-related mortality (RR 0.81, 95% CI 0.49 to 1.32, two studies, N = 18,698), and this finding was confirmed when the analysis was restricted to studies with low risk of bias. The effect on prostate cancer was imprecise (RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.71 to 1.14, four studies, N = 19,110), and when the analysis was limited to trials with low risk of bias, the interventions showed no effect (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.90 to 1.14, three studies, N = 18,183). The risk of non-melanoma skin cancer was increased (RR 1.44, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.17, three studies, N = 1900). Results of two trials-the Nutritional Prevention of Cancer Trial (NPCT) and the Selenium and Vitamin E Cancer Trial (SELECT)-also raised concerns about possible increased risk of type 2 diabetes, alopecia and dermatitis due to selenium supplements. An early hypothesis generated by NPCT that individuals with the lowest blood selenium levels at baseline could reduce their risk of cancer, particularly of prostate cancer, by increasing selenium intake has not been confirmed by subsequent trials. As the RCT participants were overwhelmingly male (94%), gender differences could not be systematically assessed.Authors' conclusions: Although an inverse association between selenium exposure and the risk of some types of cancer was found in some observational studies, this cannot be taken as evidence of a causal relation, and these results should be interpreted with caution. These studies have many limitations, including issues with assessment of exposure to selenium and to its various chemical forms, heterogeneity, confounding and other biases. Conflicting results including inverse, null and direct associations have been reported for some cancer types.RCTs assessing the effects of selenium supplementation on cancer risk have yielded inconsistent results, although the most recent studies, characterised by a low risk of bias, found no beneficial effect on cancer risk, more specifically on risk of prostate cancer, as well as little evidence of any influence of baseline selenium status. Rather, some trials suggest harmful effects of selenium exposure. To date, no convincing evidence suggests that selenium supplements can prevent cancer in humans.US: http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD005195.pub3/abstractRecord #107 of 271ID: CD010638AU: Romantsik OlgaAU: Bruschettini MatteoAU: Tosca Maria AngelaAU: Zappettini SimonaAU: Della Casa Alberighi OrnellaAU: Calevo Maria GraziaTI: Oral and sublingual immunotherapy for egg allergySO: Cochrane Database of Systematic ReviewsYR: 2014NO: 11PB: John Wiley & Sons, LtdKY: Administration, Oral;Desensitization, Immunologic [adverse effects] [methods];Egg Hypersensitivity [therapy];Egg Proteins, Dietary [administration & dosage] [immunology];Epinephrine [therapeutic use];Immunoglobulin E [immunology];Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic;Sublingual Immunotherapy [adverse effects] [methods];Child[checkword];Child, Preschool[checkword];Humans[checkword]CC: TOBACCODOI: 10.1002/14651858.CD010638.pub2AB: Background: Clinical egg allergy is a common food allergy. Current management relies upon strict allergen avoidance. Oral immunotherapy (OIT) might be an optional treatment, through desensitization to egg allergen.Objectives: We aimed to assess the successful desensitization and development of tolerance to egg protein and the safety of egg oral and sublingual immunotherapy in children and adults with immunoglobulin E (IgE)-mediated egg allergy as compared to a placebo treatment or an avoidance strategy.Search methods: We searched 13 databases for journal articles, conference proceedings, theses and unpublished trials using a combination of subject headings and text words (the last search was on 5 December 2013).Selection criteria: Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were included. All age groups with clinical egg allergy were to be included.Data collection and analysis: We retrieved 83 studies from the electronic searches. We selected studies, extracted data and assessed the methodological quality. We attempted to contact the study investigators to obtain the unpublished data, wherever possible. We used the I² statistic to assess statistical heterogeneity. We estimated a pooled risk ratio (RR) with 95% confidence interval (CI) for each outcome using a Mantel-Haenzel fixed-effect model if statistical heterogeneity was low (I² value less than 50%).Main results: We included four RCTs with a total of 167 recruited individuals (OIT 100; control 67 participants), all of whom were children (aged four to 15 years). One study used a placebo and three studies used an avoidance diet as the control. Each study used a different OIT protocol. Thirty nine per cent of OIT participants were able to tolerate a full serving of egg compared to 11.9% of the controls (RR 3.39, 95% CI 1.74 to 6.62). Forty per cent of OIT participants could ingest a partial serving of egg (1 g to 7.5 g; RR 5.73, 95% CI 3.13 to 10.50). Sixty nine per cent of the participants presented with mild-to-severe adverse effects (AEs) during OIT (RR 6.06, 95% CI 3.11 to 11.83). Five of the 100 participants receiving OIT required epinephrine. We cannot comment on whether over- or under-reporting of AEs was a concern based on the available data. Overall there was inconsistent methodological rigour in the trials.Authors' conclusions: The studies were small and the quality of evidence was low. Current evidence suggests that OIT can desensitize a large number of egg-allergic patients, although it remains unknown whether long-term tolerance develops. A major difficulty of OIT is the frequency of AEs, though these are usually mild and self-limiting. The use of epinephrine while on OIT seems infrequent. There are no standardized protocols for OIT and guidelines would be required prior to incorporating desensitization into clinical practice.US: http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD010638.pub2/abstractRecord #108 of 271ID: CD003638AU: Vermeire Etienne IJJAU: Wens JohanAU: Van Royen PaulAU: Biot YvesAU: Hearnshaw HilaryAU: Lindenmeyer AntjeTI: Interventions for improving adherence to treatment recommendations in people with type 2 diabetes mellitusSO: Cochrane Database of Systematic ReviewsYR: 2005NO: 2PB: John Wiley & Sons, LtdKY: Patient Compliance [psychology];Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2 [psychology] [therapy];Health Behavior;Patient Education as Topic;Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic;Humans[checkword]CC: ENDOCDOI: 10.1002/14651858.CD003638.pub2AB: Background: Research suggests adherence to treatment recommendations is low. In type 2 diabetes, which is a chronic condition slowly leading to serious vascular, nephrologic, neurologic and ophthalmological complications, it can be assumed that enhancing adherence to treatment recommendations may lead to a reduction of complications. Treatment regimens in type 2 diabetes are complicated, encompassing life-style adaptations and medication intake.Objectives: To assess the effects of interventions for improving adherence to treatment recommendations in people with type 2 diabetes mellitus.Search methods: Studies were obtained from searches of multiple electronic bibliographic databases supplemented with hand searches of references.Selection criteria: Randomised controlled and controlled clinical trials, before-after studies and epidemiological studies, assessing changes in adherence to treatment recommendations, as defined in the objectives section, were included.Data collection and analysis: Two teams of reviewers independently assessed the trials identified for inclusion. Three teams of two reviewers assessed trial quality and extracted data. The analysis for the narrative part was performed by one reviewer (EV), the meta-analysis by two reviewers (EV, JW).Main results: Twenty-one studies assessing interventions aiming at improving adherence to treatment recommendations, not to diet or exercise recommendations, in people living with type 2 diabetes in primary care, outpatient settings, community and hospital settings, were included. Outcomes evaluated in these studies were heterogeneous, there was a variety of adherence measurement instruments. Nurse led interventions, home aids, diabetes education, pharmacy led interventions, adaptation of dosing and frequency of medication taking showed a small effect on a variety of outcomes including HbA1c. No data on mortality and morbidity, nor on quality of life could be found.Authors' conclusions: Current efforts to improve or to facilitate adherence of people with type 2 diabetes to treatment recommendations do not show significant effects nor harms. The question whether any intervention enhances adherence to treatment recommendations in type 2 diabetes effectively, thus still remains unanswered.US: http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD003638.pub2/abstractRecord #109 of 271ID: CD003642AU: Liu Jian PingAU: Zhang MeiAU: Wang WeiyaAU: Grimsgaard SamelineTI: Chinese herbal medicines for type 2 diabetes mellitusSO: Cochrane Database of Systematic ReviewsYR: 2002NO: 3PB: John Wiley & Sons, LtdKY: Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2 [drug therapy];Drugs, Chinese Herbal [therapeutic use];Hypoglycemic Agents [therapeutic use];Phytotherapy [methods];Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic;Humans[checkword]DOI: 10.1002/14651858.CD003642.pub2AB: Background: Traditional Chinese herbal medicines have been used for a long time to treat diabetes, and many controlled trials have been done to investigate their efficacy.Objectives: To assess the effects of Chinese herbal medicines in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.Search methods: We searched the following electronic databases: The Cochrane Library (CENTRAL), the Chinese BioMedical Database, MEDLINE, EMBASE, and LILACS, combined with hand searches on Chinese journals and conference proceedings. No language restriction was used.Selection criteria: Randomised trials of herbal medicines (with at least two months treatment duration) compared with placebo, pharmacological or non-pharmacological interventions were included.Data collection and analysis: Data were extracted independently by two reviewers. The methodological quality of trials was evaluated using the parameters of randomisation, allocation concealment, double blinding, and drop-out rates. Meta-analyses were performed where data were available.Main results: Sixty-six randomised trials, involving 8302 participants, met the inclusion criteria. Methodological quality was generally low. Sixty-nine different herbal medicines were tested in the included trials, which compared herbal medicines with placebo, hypoglycaemic drugs, or herbal medicines plus hypoglycaemic drugs.     Compared with placebo, Holy basil leaves, Xianzhen Pian, Qidan Tongmai, traditional Chinese formulae (TCT), Huoxue Jiangtang Pingzhi, and Inolter showed significantly hypoglycaemic response. Compared with hypoglycaemic drugs including glibenclamide, tolbutamide, or gliclazide, seven herbal medicines demonstrated a significant better metabolic control, including Bushen Jiangtang Tang, Composite Trichosanthis, Jiangtang Kang, Ketang Ling, Shenqi Jiangtang Yin, Xiaoke Tang, and Yishen Huoxue Tiaogan. In 29 trials that evaluated herbal medicines combined with hypoglycaemic drugs, 15 different herbal preparations showed additional better effects than hypoglycaemic drugs monotherapy. Two herbal therapies combined with diet and behaviour change showed better hypoglycaemic effects than diet and behaviour change alone. No serious adverse effects from the herbal medicines were reported.Authors' conclusions: Some herbal medicines show hypoglycaemic effect sin type 2 diabetes. However, these findings should be carefully interpreted due to the low methodological quality, small sample size, and limited number of trials. In the light of some positive findings, some herbal medicines deserve further examination in high-quality trials.US: http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD003642.pub2/abstractRecord #110 of 271ID: CD002968AU: Thomas DianaAU: Elliott Elizabeth JAU: Naughton Geraldine ATI: Exercise for type 2 diabetes mellitusSO: Cochrane Database of Systematic ReviewsYR: 2006NO: 3PB: John Wiley & Sons, LtdKY: Blood Glucose [metabolism];Body Mass Index;Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2 [metabolism] [therapy];Exercise [physiology];Hemoglobin A, Glycosylated [metabolism];Obesity [therapy];Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic;Subcutaneous Fat [pathology];Weight Loss;Female[checkword];Humans[checkword];Male[checkword]CC: ENDOCDOI: 10.1002/14651858.CD002968.pub2AB: Background: Exercise is generally recommended for people with type 2 diabetes mellitus. However, some studies evaluate an exercise intervention including diet or behaviour modification or both, and the effects of diet and exercise are not differentiated. Some exercise studies involve low participant numbers, lacking power to show significant differences which may appear in larger trials.Objectives: To assess the effects of exercise in type 2 diabetes mellitus.Search methods: Trials were identified through the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE and manual searches of bibliographies.Selection criteria: All randomised controlled trials comparing any type of well-documented aerobic, fitness or progressive resistance training exercise with no exercise in people with type 2 diabetes mellitus.Data collection and analysis: Two authors independently selected trials, assessed trial quality and extracted data. Study authors were contacted for additional information. Any information on adverse effects was collected from the trials.Main results: Fourteen randomised controlled trials comparing exercise against no exercise in type 2 diabetes were identified involving 377 participants. Trials ranged from eight weeks to twelve months duration. Compared with the control, the exercise intervention significantly improved glycaemic control as indicated by a decrease in glycated haemoglobin levels of 0.6% (-0.6 % HbA1c, 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.9 to -0.3; P < 0.05). This result is both statistically and clinically significant. There was no significant difference between groups in whole body mass, probably due to an increase in fat free mass (muscle) with exercise, as reported in one trial (6.3 kg, 95% CI 0.0 to 12.6). There was a reduction in visceral adipose tissue with exercise (-45.5 cm2, 95% CI -63.8 to -27.3), and subcutaneous adipose tissue also decreased. No study reported adverse effects in the exercise group or diabetic complications. The exercise intervention significantly increased insulin response (131 AUC, 95% CI 20 to 242) (one trial), and decreased plasma triglycerides (-0.25 mmol/L, 95% CI -0.48 to -0.02). No significant difference was found between groups in quality of life (one trial), plasma cholesterol or blood pressure.Authors' conclusions: The meta-analysis shows that exercise significantly improves glycaemic control and reduces visceral adipose tissue and plasma triglycerides, but not plasma cholesterol, in people with type 2 diabetes, even without weight loss.US: http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD002968.pub2/abstractRecord #111 of 271ID: CD010085AU: Gunaratne Anoja WAU: Makrides MariaAU: Collins Carmel TTI: Maternal prenatal and/or postnatal n-3 long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LCPUFA) supplementation for preventing allergies in early childhoodSO: Cochrane Database of Systematic ReviewsYR: 2015NO: 7PB: John Wiley & Sons, LtdKY: Dietary Supplements;Age Factors;Fatty Acids, Omega-3 [administration & dosage];Food Hypersensitivity [prevention & control];Hypersensitivity [prevention & control];Immunoglobulin E [immunology];Postnatal Care;Prenatal Care;Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic;Child, Preschool[checkword];Female[checkword];Humans[checkword];Infant[checkword];Infant, Newborn[checkword];Pregnancy[checkword]CC: PREGDOI: 10.1002/14651858.CD010085.pub2AB: Background: Allergies have become more prevalent globally over the last 20 years. Dietary consumption of n-3 (or omega 3) long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LCPUFA) has declined over the same period of time. This, together with the known role of n-3 LCPUFA in inhibiting inflammation, has resulted in speculation that n-3 LCPUFA may prevent allergy development. Dietary n-3 fatty acids supplements may change the developing immune system of the newborn before allergic responses are established, particularly for those with a genetic predisposition to the production of the immunoglobulin E (IgE) antibody. Individuals with IgE-mediated allergies have both the signs and symptoms of the allergic disease and a positive skin prick test (SPT) to the allergen.Objectives: To assess the effect of n-3 LCPUFA supplementation in pregnant and/or breastfeeding women on allergy outcomes (food allergy, atopic dermatitis (eczema), allergic rhinitis (hay fever) and asthma/wheeze) in their children.Search methods: We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group’s Trials Register (6 August 2014), PubMed (1966 to 01 August 2014), CINAHL via EBSCOhost (1984 to 01 August 2014), Scopus (1995 to 01 August 2014), Web of Knowledge (1864 to 01 August 2014) and ClinicalTrials.gov (01 August 2014) and reference lists of retrieved studies.Selection criteria: We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating the effect of n-3 LCPUFA supplementation of pregnant and/or lactating women (compared with placebo or no treatment) on allergy outcomes of the infants or children. Trials using a cross-over design and trials examining biochemical outcomes only were not eligible for inclusion.Data collection and analysis: Two review authors independently assessed eligibility and trial quality and performed data extraction. Where the review authors were also investigators on trials selected, an independent reviewer assessed trial quality and performed data extraction.Main results: Eight trials involving 3366 women and their 3175 children were included in the review. In these trials, women were supplemented with n-3 LCPUFA during pregnancy (five trials), lactation (two trials) or both pregnancy and lactation (one trial). All trials randomly allocated women to either a n-3 LCPUFA supplement or a control group. The risk of bias varied across the eight included trials in this review with only two trials with a low risk of selection, performance and attrition bias.N-3 LCPUFA supplementation showed a clear reduction in the primary outcome of any allergy (medically diagnosed IgE mediated) in children aged 12 to 36 months (risk ratio (RR) 0.66, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.44 to 0.98; two RCTs; 823 children), but not beyond 36 months (RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.61 to 1.20; one RCT, 706 children). For any allergy (medically diagnosed IgE mediated and/or parental report), no clear differences were seen in children either at 12 to 36 months (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.71 to 1.11; two RCTs, 823 children) or beyond 36 months of age (RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.84 to 1.09; three RCTs, 1765 children).For the secondary outcomes of specific allergies there were no clear differences for food allergies at 12 to 36 months and beyond 36 months, but a clear reduction was seen for children in their first 12 months with n-3 LCPUFA (both for medically diagnosed IgE mediated and medically diagnosed IgE mediated and/or parental report). There was a clear reduction in medically diagnosed IgE-mediated eczema with n-3 LCPUFA for children 12 to 36 months of age, but not at any other time point for both medically diagnosed IgE mediated and medically diagnosed IgE mediated and/or parental report. No clear differences for allergic rhinitis or asthma/wheeze were seen at any time point for both medically diagnosed IgE mediated, and medically diagnosed IgE mediated and/or parental report.There was a clear reduction in children's sensitisation to egg and sensitisation to any allergen between 12 to 36 months of age when mothers were supplemented with n-3 LCPUFA.In terms of safety for the mother and child, n-3 LCPUFA supplementation during pregnancy did not show increased risk of postpartum haemorrhage or early childhood infections.Authors' conclusions: Overall, there is limited evidence to support maternal n-3 LCPUFA supplementation during pregnancy and/or lactation for reducing allergic disease in children. Few differences in childhood allergic disease were seen between women who were supplemented with n-3 LCPUFA and those who were not.US: http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD010085.pub2/abstractRecord #112 of 271ID: CD000460AU: Ardern KateTI: Tartrazine exclusion for allergic asthmaSO: Cochrane Database of Systematic ReviewsYR: 2001NO: 4PB: John Wiley & Sons, LtdKY: Asthma [chemically induced] [prevention & control];Food Coloring Agents [administration & dosage] [adverse effects];Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic;Tartrazine [administration & dosage] [adverse effects];Humans[checkword]CC: AIRWAYSDOI: 10.1002/14651858.CD000460AB: Background: Tartrazine is the best known and one of the most commonly used food additives. Food colorants are also used in many medications as well as foods. There has been conflicting evidence as to whether tartrazine causes exacerbations of asthma with some studies finding a positive association especially in individuals with cross-sensitivity to aspirin.Objectives: To assess the overall effect of tartrazine (exclusion or challenge) in the management of asthma.Search methods: A search was carried out on the Cochrane Airways Group Specialised Register. Bibliographies of each RCT was searched for additional papers. Authors of identified RCTs were contacted for further information. Searches are updated annually and are current as of February 2006.Selection criteria: RCTs of oral administration of tartrazine (as a challenge) versus placebo or dietary avoidance of tartrazine versus normal diet were considered. Studies which focused upon allergic asthma, were also included. Studies of tartrazine exclusion for other allergic conditions such as hay fever, allergic rhinitis and eczema were only considered if the results for subjects with asthma were separately identified. Trials could be in either adults or children with asthma or allergic asthma (e.g. sensitivity to aspirin or food items known to contain tartrazine).Data collection and analysis: Study quality was assessed and data abstracted by two reviewers independently. Outcomes were analysed using RevMan 4.1.1.Main results: Ninety four abstracts were found, of which 20 were potentially relevant. Six ? met the inclusion criteria, but only three presented results in a format that permitted analysis and none could be combined in a meta-analysis. In none of the studies did tartrazine challenge or avoidance in diet significantly alter asthma outcomes.Authors' conclusions: Due to the paucity of available evidence, it is not possible to provide firm conclusions as to the effects of tartrazine on asthma control. However, the six RCTs that could be included in this review all arrived at the same conclusion. Routine tartrazine exclusion may not benefit most patients, except those very few individuals with proven sensitivity.US: http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD000460/abstractRecord #113 of 271ID: CD000253AU: Evans Jennifer RAU: Lawrenson John GTI: Antioxidant vitamin and mineral supplements for preventing age-related macular degenerationSO: Cochrane Database of Systematic ReviewsYR: 2012NO: 6PB: John Wiley & Sons, LtdKY: Dietary Supplements;Antioxidants [administration & dosage];Macular Degeneration [prevention & control];Minerals [administration & dosage];Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic;Vitamins [administration & dosage];alpha-Tocopherol [administration & dosage];beta Carotene [administration & dosage];Humans[checkword]CC: EYESDOI: 10.1002/14651858.CD000253.pub3AB: Background: There is inconclusive evidence from observational studies to suggest that people who eat a diet rich in antioxidant vitamins (carotenoids, vitamins C and E) or minerals (selenium and zinc) may be less likely to develop age-related macular degeneration (AMD).Objectives: To examine the evidence as to whether or not taking antioxidant vitamin or mineral supplements prevents the development of AMD.Search methods: We searched CENTRAL (which contains the Cochrane Eyes and Vision Group Trials Register) (The Cochrane Library 2011, Issue 12), MEDLINE (January 1950 to January 2012), EMBASE (January 1980 to January 2012), Open Grey (System for Information on Grey Literature in Europe) (www.opengrey.eu/), the metaRegister of Controlled Trials (mRCT) (www.controlled-trials.com), ClinicalTrials.gov (www.clinicaltrials.gov) and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) (www.who.int/ictrp/search/en). There were no date or language restrictions in the electronic searches for trials. The electronic databases were last searched on 26 January 2012.Selection criteria: We included all randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing an antioxidant vitamin and/or mineral supplement (alone or in combination) to control.Data collection and analysis: Both review authors independently assessed risk of bias in the included studies and extracted data. One author entered data into RevMan 5 and the other author checked the data entry. We pooled data using a fixed-effect model.Main results: We included four RCTs in this review; 62,520 people were included in the analyses. The trials were conducted in Australia, Finland and the USA and investigated vitamin E and beta-carotene supplements. Overall the quality of the evidence was high. People who took these supplements were not at decreased (or increased) risk of developing AMD. The pooled risk ratio for any antioxidant supplement in the prevention of any AMD was 0.98 (95% confidence interval 0.89 to 1.08) and for advanced AMD was 1.05 (95% CI 0.80 to 1.39). Similar results were seen when the analyses were restricted to beta-carotene and alpha-tocopherol alone.Authors' conclusions: There is accumulating evidence that taking vitamin E or beta-carotene supplements will not prevent or delay the onset of AMD. There is no evidence with respect to other antioxidant supplements, such as vitamin C, lutein and zeaxanthin, or any of the commonly marketed multivitamin combinations. Although generally regarded as safe, vitamin supplements may have harmful effects and clear evidence of benefit is needed before they can be recommended.

The diagnosis of postpartum constipation is both subjective and objective. It is characterised by symptoms such as pain or discomfort, straining, hard lumpy stools and a sense of incomplete bowel evacuation. Haemorrhoids, pain at the episiotomy site, effects of pregnancy hormones and hematinics used in pregnancy can increase the risk of postpartum constipation. Although a high fibre diet and increased fluid intake is encouraged to assist defecation in the puerperium, pain-relieving drugs and laxatives are common drugs of choice to alleviate constipation. However, the effectiveness and safety of laxatives on the nursing mother need to be ascertained.Objectives: To evaluate the effectiveness of interventions for treating postpartum constipation.Search methods: We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (28 March 2014), the metaRegister of Controlled Trials, the US National Institutes of Health Ongoing Trials Register (ClinicalTrials.gov), the Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry (ANZCTR), the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry platform (ICTRP), the ProQuest database, Stellenbosch University database and Google Scholar (28 March 2014). We also searched the reference lists of potentially relevant studies identified by the search, reviewed articles for relevant trials and contacted experts to identify any additional published or unpublished trials (10 April 2014).Selection criteria: All randomised controlled trials comparing any intervention for the treatment of postpartum constipation to another intervention, placebo or no intervention.Interventions could include laxatives, surgery, as well as educational and behavioural interventions.Data collection and analysis: Two review authors independently screened the results of the search to select potentially relevant studies using pre-designed eligibility inclusion criteria. Discrepancies were resolved through discussion. We did not identify any studies for inclusion.Main results: We did not identify any studies that met our inclusion criteria. We excluded nine studies.Authors' conclusions: We could not make explicit conclusions on interventions for treating postpartum constipation because we found no studies for inclusion in this review. Rigorous and well-conducted large randomised controlled trials aimed at treating postpartum women diagnosed with constipation would be beneficial. These trials should also address the criteria for administering the intervention (time and stage of a diagnosis of postpartum constipation), and the safety and effectiveness of such interventions.US: http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD010273.pub2/abstractRecord #115 of 271ID: CD002137AU: Hooper LeeAU: Summerbell Carolyn DAU: Thompson RachelAU: Sills DeirdreAU: Roberts Felicia GAU: Moore Helen JAU: Davey Smith GeorgeTI: Reduced or modified dietary fat for preventing cardiovascular diseaseSO: Cochrane Database of Systematic ReviewsYR: 2012NO: 5PB: John Wiley & Sons, LtdKY: Cardiovascular Diseases [epidemiology] [prevention & control];Cholesterol [blood];Diet, Fat-Restricted [methods];Dietary Fats [administration & dosage];Fats, Unsaturated [administration & dosage];Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic;Risk Factors;Triglycerides [blood];Adult[checkword];Aged[checkword];Humans[checkword];Middle Aged[checkword]CC: VASCDOI: 10.1002/14651858.CD002137.pub3AB: Background: Reduction and modification of dietary fats have differing effects on cardiovascular risk factors (such as serum cholesterol), but their effects on important health outcomes are less clear.Objectives: To assess the effect of reduction and/or modification of dietary fats on mortality, cardiovascular mortality, cardiovascular morbidity and individual outcomes including myocardial infarction, stroke and cancer diagnoses in randomised clinical trials of at least 6 months duration.Search methods: For this review update, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE and EMBASE, were searched through to June 2010. References of Included studies and reviews were also checked.Selection criteria: Trials fulfilled the following criteria: 1) randomised with appropriate control group, 2) intention to reduce or modify fat or cholesterol intake (excluding exclusively omega-3 fat interventions), 3) not multi factorial, 4) adult humans with or without cardiovascular disease, 5) intervention at least six months, 6) mortality or cardiovascular morbidity data available.Data collection and analysis: Participant numbers experiencing health outcomes in each arm were extracted independently in duplicate and random effects meta-analyses, meta-regression, sub-grouping, sensitivity analyses and funnel plots were performed.Main results: This updated review suggested that reducing saturated fat by reducing and/or modifying dietary fat reduced the risk of cardiovascular events by 14% (RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.77 to 0.96, 24 comparisons, 65,508 participants of whom 7% had a cardiovascular event, I2 50%). Subgrouping suggested that this reduction in cardiovascular events was seen in studies of fat modification (not reduction - which related directly to the degree of effect on serum total and LDL cholesterol and triglycerides), of at least two years duration and in studies of men (not of women). There were no clear effects of dietary fat changes on total mortality (RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.04, 71,790 participants) or cardiovascular mortality (RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.04, 65,978 participants). This did not alter with sub-grouping or sensitivity analysis.Few studies compared reduced with modified fat diets, so direct comparison was not possible.Authors' conclusions: The findings are suggestive of a small but potentially important reduction in cardiovascular risk on modification of dietary fat, but not reduction of total fat, in longer trials.

Despite improvements in surgical and anaesthetic techniques, postoperative morbidity, mainly in the form of pain, remains a significant clinical problem. Postoperative bacterial infection of the tonsillar fossa has been proposed as an important factor causing pain and associated morbidity, and some studies have found a reduction in morbid outcomes following the administration of perioperative antibiotics.Objectives: To determine whether perioperative antibiotics reduce pain and other morbid outcomes following tonsillectomy.Search methods: We searched the Cochrane Ear, Nose and Throat Disorders Group Trials Register; the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL); PubMed; EMBASE; CINAHL; Web of Science; BIOSIS Previews; Cambridge Scientific Abstracts; ICTRP and additional sources for published and unpublished trials. The date of the most recent search was 20 March 2012.Selection criteria: All randomised controlled trials examining the impact of perioperative administration of systemic antibiotics on post-tonsillectomy morbidity in children or adults.Data collection and analysis: Two authors independently collected data. Primary outcomes were pain, consumption of analgesia and secondary haemorrhage (defined as significant if patient re-admitted, transfused blood products or returned to theatre, and total (any documented) haemorrhage). Secondary outcomes were fever, time taken to resume normal diet and activities and adverse events. Where possible, we generated summary measures using random-effects models.Main results: Ten trials, comprising a pooled total of 1035 participants, met the eligibility criteria. Most did not find a significant reduction in pain with antibiotics. Similarly, antibiotics were mostly not shown to be effective in reducing the need for analgesics. Antibiotics were not associated with a reduction in significant secondary haemorrhage rates (risk ratio (RR) 0.49, 95% CI 0.08 to 3.11, P = 0.45) or total secondary haemorrhage rates (RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.56 to 1.44, P = 0.66). With regard to secondary outcomes, antibiotics reduced the proportion of patients with fever (RR 0.63, 95% CI 0.46 to 0.85, P = 0.002).Authors' conclusions: The present systematic review, including meta-analyses for select outcomes, suggests that although individual studies vary in their findings, there is no evidence to support a consistent, clinically important impact of antibiotics in reducing the main morbid outcomes following tonsillectomy (i.e. pain, need for analgesia and secondary haemorrhage rates). The limited benefit apparent with antibiotics may be a result of positive bias introduced by several important methodological shortcomings in the included trials. Based on existing evidence, therefore, we would advocate against the routine prescription of antibiotics to patients undergoing tonsillectomy. Whether a subgroup of patients who might benefit from selective administration of antibiotics exists is unknown and needs to be explored in future trials.US: http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD005607.pub4/abstractRecord #117 of 271ID: CD004077AU: Quijano César EugenioAU: Abalos EdgardoTI: Conservative management of symptomatic and/or complicated haemorrhoids in pregnancy and the puerperiumSO: Cochrane Database of Systematic ReviewsYR: 2005NO: 3PB: John Wiley & Sons, LtdKY: Hemorrhoids [drug therapy] [therapy];Hydroxyethylrutoside [therapeutic use];Pregnancy Complications, Cardiovascular [drug therapy] [therapy];Puerperal Disorders [therapy];Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic;Vasoconstrictor Agents [therapeutic use];Female[checkword];Humans[checkword];Pregnancy[checkword]CC: PREGDOI: 10.1002/14651858.CD004077.pub2AB: Background: Haemorrhoids (piles) are swollen veins at or near the anus, normally asymptomatic. They do not constitute a disease, unless they become symptomatic. Pregnancy and the puerperium predispose to symptomatic haemorrhoids, being the most common ano-rectal disease at these stages. Symptoms are usually mild and transient and include intermittent bleeding from the anus and pain. Depending on the degree of pain, quality of life could be affected, varying from mild discomfort to real difficulty in dealing with the activities of everyday life. Treatment during pregnancy is mainly directed to the relief of symptoms, especially pain control. The so-called conservative management includes dietary modifications, stimulants or depressants of the bowel transit, local treatment, and phlebotonics (drugs that cause decreased capillary fragility, improving the microcirculation in venous insufficiency). For many women, symptoms will resolve spontaneously soon after birth, and so any corrective treatment is usually deferred to some time after birth. Thus, the objective of this review is to evaluate the efficacy of conservative management of piles during pregnancy and the puerperium.Objectives: To determine the possible benefits, risks and side-effects of the conservative management of symptomatic haemorrhoids during pregnancy and the puerperium.Search methods: We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (March 2010).Selection criteria: Randomised-controlled trials comparing any of the conservative treatments for symptomatic haemorrhoids during pregnancy and the puerperium (such as dietary modifications, stimulant/depressant of the bowel transit, local treatments, drugs that improve the microcirculation in venous insufficiency) with a placebo or no treatment.Data collection and analysis: Two review authors independently performed a methodological assessment for deciding which studies to include/exclude from the review and extracted data.Main results: From 10 potentially eligible studies, two were included in this review (150 women). Both compared oral rutosides against placebo. Rutosides seem to be effective in reducing the signs identified by the healthcare provider, and symptoms and signs reported by women, of haemorrhoidal disease. For the outcome no response to treatment: risk ratio 0.07, 95% confidence interval 0.03 to 0.20. Regarding perinatal outcomes, one fetal death and one congenital malformation (possible not related to exposure) were reported in the control and treatment group respectively.Authors' conclusions: Although the treatment with oral hydroxyethylrutosides looks promising for symptom relief in first and second degree haemorrhoids, its use cannot be recommended until new evidence reassures women and their clinicians about their safety. The most commonly used approaches, such as dietary modifications and local treatments, were not properly evaluated during pregnancy and the puerperium.US: http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD004077.pub2/abstractRecord #118 of 271ID: CD004931AU: Fernandes Marcos APAU: Atallah Álvaro NAU: Soares BernardoAU: Saconato HumbertoAU: Guimarães Sandra MAU: Matos DelcioAU: Carneiro Monteiro Larissa RAU: Richter BerndTI: Intragastric balloon for obesitySO: Cochrane Database of Systematic ReviewsYR: 2007NO: 1PB: John Wiley & Sons, LtdKY: Gastric Balloon;Weight Loss;Obesity [therapy];Obesity, Morbid [therapy];Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic;Humans[checkword]CC: ENDOCDOI: 10.1002/14651858.CD004931.pub2AB: Background: Obesity is one of the major public health problems of modern society. Intragastric balloon (IGB) treatment for obesity has been developed as a temporary aid. Its primary objective is the treatment of obese people, who have had unsatisfactory results in their clinical treatment for obesity, despite of being cared for by a multidisciplinary team, and super obese patients with a higher surgical risk. However, the effects of different IGB procedures compared with conventional treatments and with each other are uncertain.Objectives: To assess the effects of intragastric balloon in people with obesity.Search methods: Studies were obtained from computerised searches of MEDLINE, EMBASE, LILACS, The Cochrane Library and other electronic databases. Furthermore, reference lists of relevant articles and hand searches of selected journals were performed. Experts in the field were contacted.Selection criteria: Randomised and quasi-randomised controlled trials fulfilling the inclusion criteria were used. Short term weight loss is common, so studies were included if they reported measurements after a minimum of four weeks follow-up.Data collection and analysis: Data were extracted by one reviewer and checked independently by two reviewers. Two reviewers independently assessed the quality of trials.Main results: Nine randomised controlled trials involving 395 patients were included. Six out of nine studies had a follow-up of less than one year, the longest study duration was 24 months. Only a third of the analysed studies revealed a low risk of bias. No information was available on quality of life, all-cause mortality and morbidity. Compared with conventional management, IGB did not show convincing evidence of a greater weight loss. On the other hand, complications of intragastric balloon placement occurred, however few of a serious nature. The relative risks for minor complications like gastric ulcers and erosions were significantly raised.Authors' conclusions: Evidence from this review is limited for decision making, since there was large heterogeneity in IGB trials, regarding both methodological and clinical aspects. However, a co-adjuvant factor described by some authors in the loss and maintenance of weight has been the motivation and the encouragement to changing eating habits following a well-organized diet and a program of behavioural modification. The IGB alone and the technique of positioning appear to be safe. Despite the evidence for little additional benefit of the intragastric balloon in the loss of weight, its cost should be considered against a program of eating and behavioural modification.US: http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD004931.pub2/abstractRecord #119 of 271ID: CD008189AU: Anderson KirstyAU: Norman Robert JAU: Middleton PhilippaTI: Preconception lifestyle advice for people with subfertilitySO: Cochrane Database of Systematic ReviewsYR: 2010NO: 4PB: John Wiley & Sons, LtdKY: Life Style;Smoking Cessation;Counseling [methods];Infertility [therapy];Live Birth;Preconception Care [methods];Female[checkword];Humans[checkword]DOI: 10.1002/14651858.CD008189.pub2AB: Background: Infertility is a prevalent problem and has significant consequences for individuals, families and the wider community. People's chance of having a healthy, live birth may be impacted upon by factors such as weight, diet, smoking, other substance abuse, environmental pollutants, infections, medical conditions, medications and family medical history. However, there is no current guideline about what preconception advice should be offered to people presenting for infertility treatment. It is important to determine what preconception advice should be given about these types of factors to such people in order to help them to make positive changes and hopefully improve their chances of conception and delivering a healthy, live baby.Objectives: To assess the effects of preconception advice on the chances of a live birth for people who perceive that they may be infertile and are investigating the possibility of medical treatment to address subfertility.Search methods: All published and unpublished randomised controlled trials addressing preconception advice to influence lifestyle factors in people who perceived that they may be infertile and investigated the possibility of medical treatment to address subfertility were sought from the Cochrane Menstrual Disorders and Subfertility Review Group Trials Register, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, PubMed, EMBASE, PsycINFO, AMED, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), LILACS, trial registers for ongoing and registered trials, citation indexes, ISI Web of Knowledge, Clinical Study Results database, OpenSIGLE database, China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) Periodical Index and Google (inception to 5 October 2009).Selection criteria: Only randomised controlled trials (RCTs), including cluster-randomised (group-randomised) trials, that considered preconception advice given to individuals who perceived that they may be infertile and were investigating the possibility of medical treatment from subfertility specialist services were eligible for inclusion. The primary outcome was live birth, defined as delivery of a live fetus after 20 completed weeks of gestation.Data collection and analysis: Two review authors independently applied eligibility criteria to, extracted data from and assessed the risk of bias in the single included trial.Main results: One trial assessing smoking cessation advice for 94 infertile women smokers fulfilled the criteria for this review, but the trial did not report on the review's primary outcome of live birth or any other fertility-related outcomes. This trial of women attending a fertility clinic showed that smoking cessation advice tailored to a woman's "stage-of-change" (readiness to stop smoking) did not show significant evidence of a difference in stage (including smoking cessation rates) compared with standard clinical advice.Authors' conclusions: No RCTs were located that assessed the effects of preconception advice on the chance of a live birth or other fertility outcomes in people who perceived that they may be infertile and were investigating the possibility of medical treatment to address subfertility. Given the lack of RCTs evaluating the effectiveness of preconception lifestyle advice for people in the afore-mentioned population, this review cannot provide guidance for clinical practice in this area. However, it does highlight the need for further research into this important subject.US: http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD008189.pub2/abstractRecord #120 of 271ID: CD008419AU: van Sonsbeek SanneAU: Pullens BasAU: van Benthem Peter PaulTI: Positive pressure therapy for Ménière's disease or syndromeSO: Cochrane Database of Systematic ReviewsYR: 2015NO: 3PB: John Wiley & Sons, LtdKY: Meniere Disease [therapy];Middle Ear Ventilation;Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic;Syndrome;Transtympanic Micropressure Treatment [instrumentation] [methods];Humans[checkword]CC: ENTDOI: 10.1002/14651858.CD008419.pub2AB: Background: Ménière's disease is an incapacitating disease in which recurrent attacks of vertigo are accompanied by hearing loss, tinnitus and/or aural fullness, all of which are discontinuous and variable in intensity. A number of different therapies have been identified for patients with this disease, ranging from dietary measures (e.g. a low-salt diet) and medication (e.g. betahistine (Serc®), diuretics) to extensive surgery (e.g. endolymphatic sac surgery). The Meniett® low-pressure pulse generator (Medtronic ENT, 1999) is a device that is designed to generate a computer-controlled sequence of low-pressure (micro-pressure) pulses, which are thought to be transmitted to the vestibular system of the inner ear. The pressure pulse passes via a tympanostomy tube (grommet) to the middle ear, and hence to the inner ear via the round and/or oval window. The hypothesis is that these low-pressure pulses reduce endolymphatic hydrops.Objectives: To assess the effects of positive pressure therapy (e.g. the Meniett device) on the symptoms of Ménière's disease or syndrome.Search methods: We searched the Cochrane Ear, Nose and Throat Disorders Group Trials Register; the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL); PubMed; EMBASE; CINAHL; Web of Science; Cambridge Scientific Abstracts; ICTRP and additional sources for published and unpublished trials. The date of the search was 6 June 2014.Selection criteria: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing positive pressure therapy (using the Meniett or a similar device) with placebo in patients with Ménière's disease. The primary outcome was control of vertigo; secondary outcomes were loss or gain of hearing, severity of tinnitus, perception of aural fullness, functional level, complications or adverse effects, and sick days.Data collection and analysis: Two authors independently selected studies, assessed risk of bias and extracted data. We contacted authors for additional data. Where possible, we pooled study results using a fixed-effect, mean difference (MD) meta-analysis and tested for statistical heterogeneity using both the Chi² test and I² statistic. This was only possible for the secondary outcomes loss or gain of hearing and sick days. We presented results using forest plots with 95% confidence intervals (Cl).Main results: We included five randomised clinical trials with 265 participants. All trials were prospective, double-blind, placebo-controlled randomised controlled trials on the effects of positive pressure therapy on vertigo complaints in Ménière's disease. Overall, the risk of bias varied: three out of five studies were at low risk, one was at unclear risk and one was at high risk of bias. Control of vertigoFor the primary outcome, control of vertigo, it was not possible to pool data due to heterogeneity in the measurement of the outcome measures. In most studies, no significant difference was found between the positive pressure therapy group and the placebo group in vertigo scores or vertigo days. Only one study, at low risk of bias, showed a significant difference in one measure of vertigo control in favour of positive pressure therapy. In this study, the mean visual analogue scale (VAS) score for vertigo after eight weeks of treatment was 25.5 in the positive pressure therapy group and 46.6 in the placebo group (mean difference (MD) -21.10, 95% CI -35.47 to -6.73; scale not stated - presumed to be 0 to 100). Secondary outcomesFor the secondary outcomes, we carried out two pooled analyses. We found statistically significant results for loss or gain of hearing . Hearing was 7.38 decibels better in the placebo group compared to the positive pressure therapy group (MD) (95% CI 2.51 to 12.25; two studies, 123 participants). The severity of tinnitus and perception of aural fullness were either not measured or inadequate data were provided in the included studies. For the secondary outcome functional level , it was not possible to perform a pooled analysis. One included study showed less functional impairment in the positive pressure group than the placebo group (AAO-HNS criteria, one- to six-point scale: MD -1.10, 95% CI -1.81 to -0.39, 40 participants); another study did not show any significant results. In addition to the predefined secondary outcome measures, we included sick days as an additional outcome measure, as two studies used this outcome measure and it is a complementary measurement of impairment due to Ménière's disease. We did not find a statistically significant difference in sick days. No complications or adverse effects were noted by any study.Authors' conclusions: There is no evidence, from five included studies, to show that positive pressure therapy is effective for the symptoms of Ménière's disease. There is some moderate quality evidence, from two studies, that hearing levels are worse in patients who use this therapy. The positive pressure therapy device itself is minimally invasive. However, in order to use it, a tympanostomy tube (grommet) needs to be inserted, with the associated risks. These include the risks of anaesthesia, the general risks of any surgery and the specific risks of otorrhoea and tympanosclerosis associated with the insertion of a tympanostomy tube. Notwithstanding these comments, no complications or adverse effects were noted in any of the included studies.US: http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD008419.pub2/abstractRecord #121 of 271ID: CD006903AU: Dale JeremyAU: Caramlau Isabela OAU: Lindenmeyer AntjeAU: Williams Susan MTI: Peer support telephone calls for improving healthSO: Cochrane Database of Systematic ReviewsYR: 2008NO: 4PB: John Wiley & Sons, LtdKY: Health Behavior;Health Status;Peer Group;Telephone;Chronic Disease;Counseling [methods];Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic;Female[checkword];Humans[checkword]CC: COMMUNDOI: 10.1002/14651858.CD006903.pub2AB: Background: Peer support telephone calls have been used for a wide range of health-related concerns. However, little is known about their effects.Objectives: To assess the effects of peer support telephone calls in terms of physical (e.g. blood pressure), psychological (e.g. depressive symptoms), and behavioural health outcomes (e.g. uptake of mammography) and other outcomes.Search methods: We searched: The Cochrane Library databases (CENTRAL, DARE, CDSR) (issue 4 2007); MEDLINE (OVID) (January 1966 to December 2007); EMBASE (OVID) (January 1985 to December 2007); CINAHL (Athens) (January 1966 to December 2007), trials registers and reference lists of articles, with no language restrictions.Selection criteria: Randomised controlled trials of peer support interventions delivered by telephone call.Data collection and analysis: Two review authors independently extracted data. We present results narratively and in tabular format. Meta-analysis was not possible due to heterogeneity between studies.Main results: We included seven studies involving 2492 participants.Peer support telephone calls were associated with an increase in mammography screening, with 49% of women in the intervention group and 34% of women in the control group receiving a mammogram since the start of the intervention (P </ = 0.001). In another study, peer telephone support calls were found to maintain mammography screening uptake for baseline adherent women (P = 0.029).Peer support telephone calls for post myocardial infarction patients were associated at six months with a change in diet in the intervention and usual care groups of 54% and 44% respectively (P = 0.03). In another study for post myocardial infarction patients there were no significant differences between groups for self-efficacy, health status and mental health outcomes.Peer support telephone calls were associated with greater continuation of breastfeeding in mothers at 3 months post partum (P = 0.01).Peer support telephone calls were associated with reduced depressive symptoms in mothers with postnatal depression (Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) > 12). The peer support intervention significantly decreased depressive symptomatology at the 4-week assessment (odds ratio (OR) 6.23 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.15 to 33.77; P = 0.02)) and 8-week assessment (OR 6.23 (95% CI 1.40 to 27.84; P = 0.01).  One study investigated the use of peer support for patients with poorly controlled diabetes. There were no significant differences between groups for self-efficacy, HbA1C, cholesterol level and body mass index.Authors' conclusions: Whilst this review provides some evidence that peer support telephone calls can be effective for certain health-related concerns, few of the studies were of high quality and so results should be interpreted cautiously. There were many methodological limitations thus limiting the generalisability of findings. Overall, there is a need for further well designed randomised controlled studies to clarify the cost and clinical effectiveness of peer support telephone calls for improvement in health and health-related behaviour.US: http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD006903.pub2/abstractRecord #122 of 271ID: CD001687AU: Duley LeliaAU: Henderson-Smart David JTI: Reduced salt intake compared to normal dietary salt, or high intake, in pregnancySO: Cochrane Database of Systematic ReviewsYR: 1999NO: 3PB: John Wiley & Sons, LtdKY: Prenatal Care;Sodium, Dietary;Patient Education as Topic;Female[checkword];Humans[checkword];Pregnancy[checkword]CC: PREGDOI: 10.1002/14651858.CD001687AB: Background: In the past women have been advised that lowering their salt intake might reduce their risk of pre-eclampsia. Although this practice has largely ceased, it remains important to assess the evidence about possible effects of advice to alter dietary salt intake during pregnancy.Objectives: The objective of this review was to assess the effects of dietary advice to alter salt intake compared to continuing a normal diet, on the risk of pre-eclampsia and its consequences.Search methods: We searched the register of trials maintained and updated by the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group, and the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register Disc Issue 4, 1998.Selection criteria: Studies were included if they were randomised trials of advice to either reduce or to increase dietary salt during pregnancy.Data collection and analysis: All data were extracted independently by both reviewers.Main results: Two trials were included, with 603 women. They compared advice about a low salt diet with no dietary advice. The confidence intervals for all of the outcomes reported were wide, and cross the no effect line. This includes pre-eclampsia (relative risk 1.11, 95% confidence interval 0.46 to 2.66). Even when taken together, these trials are insufficient to provide reliable information about the effects of advice on salt restriction during normal pregnancy.None of the trials included women with pre-eclampsia, so this review provides no reliable information about changes in salt intake for treatment of pre-eclampsia.Authors' conclusions: Salt consumption during pregnancy should remain a matter of personal preference.US: http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD001687/abstractRecord #123 of 271ID: CD008959AU: De-Regil Luz MariaAU: Suchdev Parminder SAU: Vist Gunn EAU: Walleser SilkeAU: Peña-Rosas Juan PabloTI: Home fortification of foods with multiple micronutrient powders for health and nutrition in children under two years of ageSO: Cochrane Database of Systematic ReviewsYR: 2011NO: 9PB: John Wiley & Sons, LtdKY: Dietary Supplements;Food, Fortified;Anemia, Iron-Deficiency [diet therapy];Cooking [methods];Deficiency Diseases [diet therapy];Micronutrients [administration & dosage] [deficiency];Powders;Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic;Trace Elements [administration & dosage];Humans[checkword];Infant[checkword]DOI: 10.1002/14651858.CD008959.pub2AB: Background: Vitamin and mineral deficiencies, particularly those of iron, vitamin A and zinc, affect more than two billion people worldwide. Young children are highly vulnerable because of rapid growth and inadequate dietary practices. Micronutrient powders (MNP) are single-dose packets containing multiple vitamins and minerals in powder form that can be sprinkled onto any semi-solid food.The use of MNP for home or point-of-use fortification of complementary foods has been proposed as an intervention for improving micronutrient intake in children under two years of age.Objectives: To assess the effects and safety of home (point-of-use) fortification of foods with multiple micronutrient powders on nutritional, health and developmental outcomes in children under two years of age.Search methods: We searched the following databases in February 2011: Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library), MEDLINE (1948 to week 2 February 2011), EMBASE (1980 to Week 6 2011), CINAHL (1937 to current), CPCI-S (1990 to 19 February 2011), Science Citation Index (1970 to 19 February 2011), African Index Medicus (searched 23 February 2011), POPLINE (searched 21 February 2011), ClinicalTrials.gov (searched 23 February 2011), mRCT (searched 23 February 2011), and World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) (searched 23 February 2011). We also contacted relevant organisations (25 January 2011) for the identification of ongoing and unpublished studies.Selection criteria: We included randomised and quasi-randomised trials with either individual or cluster randomisation. Participants were children under the age of two years at the time of intervention, with no specific health problems. The intervention was consumption of food fortified at the point of use with multiple micronutrient powders formulated with at least iron, zinc and vitamin A compared with placebo, no intervention or the use of iron containing supplements, which is the standard practice.Data collection and analysis: Two review authors independently assessed the eligibility of studies against the inclusion criteria, extracted data from included studies and assessed the risk of bias of the included studies.Main results: We included eight trials (3748 participants) conducted in low income countries in Asia, Africa and the Caribbean, where anaemia is a public health problem. The interventions lasted between two and 12 months and the powder formulations contained between five and 15 nutrients. Six trials compared the use of MNP versus no intervention or a placebo and the other two compared the use of MNP versus daily iron drops. Most of the included trials were assessed as at low risk of bias.Home fortification with MNP reduced anaemia by 31% (six trials, RR 0.69; 95% CI 0.60 to 0.78) and iron deficiency by 51% (four trials, RR 0.49; 95% CI 0.35 to 0.67) in infants and young children when compared with no intervention or placebo, but we did not find an effect on growth.In comparison with daily iron supplementation, the use of MNP produced similar results on anaemia (one trial, RR 0.89; 95% CI 0.58 to 1.39) and haemoglobin concentrations (two trials, MD -2.36 g/L; 95% CI -10.30 to 5.58); however, given the limited amount of data these results should be interpreted cautiously.No deaths were reported in the trials and information on side effects and morbidity, including malaria, was scarce.It seems that the use of MNP is efficacious among infants and young children six to 23 months of age living in settings with different prevalences of anaemia and malaria endemicity, regardless of whether the intervention lasts two, six or 12 months or whether recipients are male or female.Authors' conclusions: Home fortification of foods with multiple micronutrient powders is an effective intervention to reduce anaemia and iron deficiency in children six months to 23 months of age. The provision of MNP is better than no intervention or placebo and possibly comparable to commonly used daily iron supplementation. The benefits of this intervention as a child survival strategy or on developmental outcomes are unclear. Data on effects on malaria outcomes are lacking and further investigation of morbidity outcomes is needed. The micronutrient powders containing multiple nutrients are well accepted but adherence is variable and in some cases comparable to that achieved in infants and young children receiving standard iron supplements as drops or syrups.US: http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD008959.pub2/abstractRecord #124 of 271ID: CD005253AU: Ibrahim Mohammed DHAU: Sinn John KHAU: McGuire WilliamTI: Iodine supplementation for the prevention of mortality and adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes in preterm infantsSO: Cochrane Database of Systematic ReviewsYR: 2006NO: 2PB: John Wiley & Sons, LtdKY: Dietary Supplements;Developmental Disabilities [etiology] [prevention & control];Enteral Nutrition;Infant Mortality;Infant, Newborn;Infant, Premature;Iodine [administration & dosage] [deficiency];Parenteral Nutrition;Humans[checkword]CC: NEONATALDOI: 10.1002/14651858.CD005253.pub2AB: Background: Parenteral nutrition solutions, formula milks, and human breast milk contain insufficient iodine to meet recommended intakes for preterm infants. Iodine deficiency may exacerbate transient hypothyroxinaemia in preterm infants and this may be associated with adverse respiratory or neurological outcomes.Objectives: To assess the evidence from randomised controlled trials that dietary supplementation with iodine reduces mortality and morbidity in preterm infants.Search methods: We used the standard search strategy of the Cochrane Neonatal Review Group. This included searches of the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, The Cochrane Library, Issue 4, 2005), MEDLINE (1966 - November 2005), EMBASE (1980 - November 2005), CINAHL (1982 - November 2005), conference proceedings, and previous reviews.Selection criteria: Randomised or quasi-randomised controlled trials that compared a policy of supplementing enteral or parenteral feeds with iodine (more than 30 micrograms per kilogram per day) versus placebo or no supplementation in preterm infants.Data collection and analysis: The standard methods of the Cochrane Neonatal Review Group, with separate evaluation of trial quality and data extraction by two reviewers, and synthesis of data using relative risk, risk difference and weighted mean difference. The primary outcomes for this review were neonatal mortality, death before hospital discharge, and longer term neurodevelopmental outcomes including severe neurodevelopmental disability.Main results: We found only one randomised controlled trial (N = 121) that fulfilled the review eligibility criteria (Rogahn 2000). The participants were infants born before 33 weeks' gestation (but most were of birth weight greater than 1000 grams). The primary aim of this trial was to assess the effect of iodine supplementation on thyroid function. The investigators did not detect any statistically significant effects on the plasma levels of thyroxine (free and total), triiodothyronine, or thyrotrophin in preterm infants (measured up to 40 weeks' post-conceptional age). Only one infant died and the trial was therefore underpowered to detect an effect on mortality. The trial did not assess the effect of the intervention on neurodevelopmental morbidity. There was not a statistically significant difference in the incidence of chronic lung disease.Authors' conclusions: There are insufficient data at present to determine whether providing preterm infants with supplemental iodine (to match fetal accretion rates) prevents morbidity and mortality in preterm infants. Future randomised controlled trials of iodine supplementation should focus on extremely preterm and extremely low birth weight infants, the group at greatest risk of transient hypothyroxinaemia. These trials should aim to assess the effect of iodine supplementation on clinically important outcomes including respiratory morbidity and longer term neurodevelopment.US: http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD005253.pub2/abstractRecord #125 of 271ID: CD003997AU: Steward David LAU: Grisel JedidiahAU: Meinzen-Derr JareenTI: Steroids for improving recovery following tonsillectomy in childrenSO: Cochrane Database of Systematic ReviewsYR: 2011NO: 8PB: John Wiley & Sons, LtdKY: Adenoidectomy [adverse effects];Antiemetics [therapeutic use];Convalescence;Dexamethasone [therapeutic use];Glucocorticoids [therapeutic use];Pain, Postoperative [prevention & control];Postoperative Nausea and Vomiting [prevention & control];Time Factors;Tonsillectomy [adverse effects];Treatment Outcome;Adolescent[checkword];Child[checkword];Humans[checkword]CC: ENTDOI: 10.1002/14651858.CD003997.pub2AB: Background: This is an update of a Cochrane Review first published in The Cochrane Library in Issue 1, 2003.Tonsillectomy continues to be one of the most common surgical procedures performed worldwide. Despite advances in anesthetic and surgical techniques, post-tonsillectomy morbidity remains a significant clinical problem.Objectives: To assess the clinical efficacy of a single intraoperative dose of dexamethasone in reducing post-tonsillectomy morbidity.Search methods: We searched the Cochrane Ear, Nose and Throat Disorders Group Trials Register; the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL); PubMed; EMBASE; CINAHL; Web of Science; BIOSIS Previews; Cambridge Scientific Abstracts; ISRCTN; and additional sources for published and unpublished trials. The date of the most recent search was 29 October 2010, following a previous search in September 2002.Selection criteria: Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials of a single dose of intravenous, intraoperative corticosteroid for pediatric patients (age < 18 years) who underwent tonsillectomy or adenotonsillectomy.Data collection and analysis: The first author extracted data regarding the primary outcome measures and measurement tools from the published studies. The first author also recorded data regarding study design, patient ages, procedures performed, dose of corticosteroid and method of delivery, as well as methodological quality. When data were missing from the original publications, we contacted the authors for more information. We performed data analysis with a random-effects model, using the RevMan 5.1 software developed by the Cochrane Collaboration.Main results: We included 19 studies (1756 participants). We selected only randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blinded studies to minimize inclusion of poor quality studies. However, the risk of bias in the included studies was not formally assessed. Children receiving a single intraoperative dose of dexamethasone (dose range = 0.15 to 1.0 mg/kg) were half as likely to vomit in the first 24 hours compared to children receiving placebo (risk ratio (RR) 0.49; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.41 to 0.58; P < 0.00001). Routine use in five children would be expected to result in one less patient experiencing post-tonsillectomy emesis (risk difference (RD) -0.24; 95% CI -0.32 to -0.15; P < 0.00001). Children receiving dexamethasone were also more likely to advance to a soft/solid diet on post-tonsillectomy day one (RR 1.45; 95% CI 1.15 to 1.83; P = 0.001) than those receiving placebo. Finally, postoperative pain was improved in children receiving dexamethasone as measured by a visual analog scale (VAS, 0 to 10) (MD -1.07; 95% CI -1.73 to -0.41; P = 0.001), which correlates clinically to a reduction in pain (on a VAS of 0 to 10) from 4.72 to 3.65. No adverse events were noted in the included studies.Authors' conclusions: The evidence suggests that a single intravenous dose of dexamethasone is an effective, safe and inexpensive treatment for reducing morbidity from pediatric tonsillectomy.US: http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD003997.pub2/abstractRecord #126 of 271ID: CD009386AU: Devi ReenaAU: Singh Sally JAU: Powell JohnAU: Fulton Emily AAU: Igbinedion EwemadeAU: Rees KarenTI: Internet-based interventions for the secondary prevention of coronary heart diseaseSO: Cochrane Database of Systematic ReviewsYR: 2015NO: 12PB: John Wiley & Sons, LtdKY: Internet;Life Style;Coronary Artery Disease [prevention & control] [rehabilitation];Diet;Exercise;Quality of Life;Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic;Risk Reduction Behavior;Secondary Prevention [methods];Aged[checkword];Humans[checkword];Middle Aged[checkword]DOI: 10.1002/14651858.CD009386.pub2AB: Background: The Internet could provide a means of delivering secondary prevention programmes to people with coronary heart disease (CHD).Objectives: To determine the effectiveness of Internet-based interventions targeting lifestyle changes and medicines management for the secondary prevention of CHD.Search methods: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, in December 2014. We also searched six other databases in October 2014, and three trials registers in January 2015 together with reference checking and handsearching to identify additional studies.Selection criteria: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating Internet-delivered secondary prevention interventions aimed at people with CHD.Data collection and analysis: Two review authors independently assessed risk of bias and extracted data according to the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions. We assessed evidence quality using the GRADE approach and presented this in a 'Summary of findings' table.Main results: Eighteen trials met our inclusion criteria. Eleven studies are complete (1392 participants), and seven are ongoing. Of the completed studies, seven interventions are broad, targeting the lifestyle management of CHD, and four focused on physical activity promotion. The comparison group in trials was usual care (n = 6), minimal intervention (n = 3), or traditional cardiac rehabilitation (n = 2).We found no effects of Internet-based interventions for all-cause mortality (odds ratio (OR) 0.27, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.04 to 1.63; participants = 895; studies = 6; low-quality evidence). There was only one case of cardiovascular mortality in a control group (participants = 895; studies = 6). No incidences of non-fatal re-infarction were reported across any of the studies. We found no effects for revascularisation (OR 0.69, 95% CI 0.37 to 1.27; participants = 895; studies = 6; low-quality evidence).We found no effects for total cholesterol (mean difference (MD) 0.00, 95% CI -0.27 to 0.28; participants = 439; studies = 4; low-quality evidence), high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol (MD 0.01, 95% CI -0.06 to 0.07; participants = 437; studies = 4; low-quality evidence), or triglycerides (MD 0.01, 95% CI -0.17 to 0.19; participants = 439; studies = 4; low-quality evidence). We did not pool the data for low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol due to considerable heterogeneity. Two out of six trials measuring LDL cholesterol detected favourable intervention effects, and four trials reported no effects. Seven studies measured systolic and diastolic blood pressure; we did not pool the data due to substantial heterogeneity. For systolic blood pressure, two studies showed a reduction with the intervention, but the remaining studies showed no effect. For diastolic blood pressure, two studies showed a reduction with the intervention, one study showed an increase with the intervention, and the remaining four studies showed no effect.Five trials measured health-related quality of life (HRQOL). We could draw no conclusions from one study due to incomplete reporting; one trial reported no effect; two studies reported a short- and medium-term effect respectively; and one study reported both short- and medium-term effects.Five trials assessed dietary outcomes: two reported favourable effects, and three reported no effects. Eight studies assessed physical activity: five of these trials reported no physical activity effects, and three reported effectiveness. Trials are yet to measure the impact of these interventions on compliance with medication.Two studies measured healthcare utilisation: one reported no effects, and the other reported increased usage of healthcare services compared to a control group in the intervention group at nine months' follow-up. Two trials collected cost data: both reported that Internet-delivered interventions are likely to be cost-effective.In terms of the risk of bias, the majority of studies reported appropriate randomisation and appropriate concealment of randomisation processes. A lack of blinding resulted in a risk of performance bias in seven studies, and a risk of detection bias in five trials. Two trials were at risk of attrition bias, and five were at risk for reporting bias.Authors' conclusions: In general, evidence was of low quality due to lack of blinding, loss to follow-up, and uncertainty around the effect size. Few studies measured clinical events, and of those that did, a very small number of events were reported, and therefore no firm conclusions can be made. Similarly, there was no clear evidence of effect for cardiovascular risk factors, although again the number of studies reporting these was small. There was some evidence for beneficial effects on HRQOL, dietary outcomes, and physical activity, although firm conclusions cannot yet be made. The effects on healthcare utilisation and cost-effectiveness are also inconclusive, and trials are yet to measure the impact of Internet interventions on compliance with medication. The comparison groups differed across trials, and there were insufficient studies with usable data for subgroup analyses. We intend to study the intensity of comparison groups in future updates of this review when more evidence is available. The completion of the ongoing trials will add to the evidence base.US: http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD009386.pub2/abstractRecord #127 of 271ID: CD009217AU: Adler Alma JAU: Taylor FionaAU: Martin NicoleAU: Gottlieb SheldonAU: Taylor Rod SAU: Ebrahim ShahTI: Reduced dietary salt for the prevention of cardiovascular diseaseSO: Cochrane Database of Systematic ReviewsYR: 2014NO: 12PB: John Wiley & Sons, LtdKY: Diet, Sodium-Restricted;Cardiovascular Diseases [mortality] [prevention & control];Hypertension [mortality];Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic;Sodium Chloride, Dietary [administration & dosage];Adult[checkword];Humans[checkword]DOI: 10.1002/14651858.CD009217.pub3AB: Background: This is an update of a Cochrane review that was first published in 2011 of the effects of reducing dietary salt intake, through advice to reduce salt intake or low-sodium salt substitution, on mortality and cardiovascular events.Objectives: 1. To assess the long-term effects of advice and salt substitution, aimed at reducing dietary salt, on mortality and cardiovascular morbidity.2. To investigate whether a reduction in blood pressure is an explanatory factor in the effect of such dietary interventions on mortality and cardiovascular outcomes.Search methods: We updated the searches of CENTRAL (2013, Issue 4), MEDLINE (OVID, 1946 to April week 3 2013), EMBASE (OVID, 1947 to 30 April 2013) and CINAHL (EBSCO, inception to 1 April 2013) and last ran these on 1 May 2013. We also checked the references of included studies and reviews. We applied no language restrictions.Selection criteria: Trials fulfilled the following criteria: (1) randomised, with follow-up of at least six months, (2) the intervention was reduced dietary salt (through advice to reduce salt intake or low-sodium salt substitution), (3) participants were adults and (4) mortality or cardiovascular morbidity data were available. Two review authors independently assessed whether studies met these criteria.Data collection and analysis: A single author extracted data and assessed study validity, and a second author checked this. We contacted trial authors where possible to obtain missing information. We extracted events and calculated risk ratios (RRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs).Main results: Eight studies met the inclusion criteria: three in normotensives (n = 3518) and five in hypertensives or mixed populations of normo- and hypertensives (n = 3766). End of trial follow-up ranged from six to 36 months and the longest observational follow-up (after trial end) was 12.7 years.The risk ratios (RR) for all-cause mortality in normotensives were imprecise and showed no evidence of reduction (end of trial RR 0.67, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.40 to 1.12, 60 deaths; longest follow-up RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.58 to 1.40, 79 deaths n=3518) or in hypertensives (end of trial RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.86 to 1.15, 565 deaths; longest follow-up RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.14, 674 deaths n=3085). There was weak evidence of benefit for cardiovascular mortality (hypertensives: end of trial RR 0.67, 95% CI 0.45 to 1.01, 106 events n=2656) and for cardiovascular events (hypertensives: end of trial RR 0.76, 95% CI 0.57 to 1.01, 194 events, four studies, n = 3397; normotensives: at longest follow-up RR 0.71, 95% CI 0.42 to 1.20, 200 events; hypertensives: RR 0.77, 95% CI 0.57 to 1.02, 192 events; pooled analysis of six trials RR 0.77, 95% CI 0.63 to 0.95, n = 5912). These findings were driven by one trial among retirement home residents that reduced salt intake in the kitchens of the homes, thereby not requiring individual behaviour change.Advice to reduce salt showed small reductions in systolic blood pressure (mean difference (MD) -1.15 mmHg, 95% CI -2.32 to 0.02 n=2079) and diastolic blood pressure (MD -0.80 mmHg, 95% CI -1.37 to -0.23 n=2079) in normotensives and greater reductions in systolic blood pressure in hypertensives (MD -4.14 mmHg, 95% CI -5.84 to -2.43 n=675), but no difference in diastolic blood pressure (MD -3.74 mmHg, 95% CI -8.41 to 0.93 n=675).Overall many of the trials failed to report sufficient detail to assess their potential risk of bias. Health-related quality of life was assessed in one trial in normotensives, which reported significant improvements in well-being but no data were presented.Authors' conclusions: Despite collating more event data than previous systematic reviews of randomised controlled trials, there is insufficient power to confirm clinically important effects of dietary advice and salt substitution on cardiovascular mortality in normotensive or hypertensive populations. Our estimates of the clinical benefits from advice to reduce dietary salt are imprecise, but are larger than would be predicted from the small blood pressure reductions achieved. Further well-powered studies would be needed to obtain more precise estimates. Our findings do not support individual dietary advice as a means of restricting salt intake. It is possible that alternative strategies that do not require individual behaviour change may be effective and merit further trials.US: http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD009217.pub3/abstractRecord #128 of 271ID: CD003288AU: Milne Anne CAU: Potter JanAU: Vivanti AngelaAU: Avenell AlisonTI: Protein and energy supplementation in elderly people at risk from malnutritionSO: Cochrane Database of Systematic ReviewsYR: 2009NO: 2PB: John Wiley & Sons, LtdKY: Dietary Supplements;Energy Intake;Dietary Proteins [administration & dosage];Length of Stay;Malnutrition [mortality] [prevention & control];Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic;Aged[checkword];Humans[checkword]CC: ENDOCDOI: 10.1002/14651858.CD003288.pub3AB: Background: Evidence for the effectiveness of nutritional supplements containing protein and energy, often prescribed for older people, is limited. Malnutrition is more common in this age group and deterioration of nutritional status can occur during illness. It is important to establish whether supplementing the diet is an effective way of improving outcomes for older people at risk from malnutrition.Objectives: This review examined trials for improvement in nutritional status and clinical outcomes when extra protein and energy were provided, usually as commercial 'sip-feeds'.Search methods: We searched The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, EMBASE, Healthstar, CINAHL, BIOSIS, CAB abstracts. We also hand searched nutrition journals and reference lists and contacted 'sip-feed' manufacturers.Selection criteria: Randomised and quasi-randomised controlled trials of oral protein and energy supplementation in older people, with the exception of groups recovering from cancer treatment or in critical care.Data collection and analysis: Two reviewers independently assessed trials prior to inclusion and independently extracted data and assessed trial quality. Authors of trials were contacted for further information as necessary.Main results: Sixty-two trials with 10,187 randomised participants have been included in the review. Maximum duration of intervention was 18 months. Most included trials had poor study quality. The pooled weighted mean difference (WMD) for percentage weight change showed a benefit of supplementation of 2.2% (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.8 to 2.5) from 42 trials. There was no significant reduction in mortality in the supplemented compared with control groups (relative risk (RR) 0.92, CI 0.81 to 1.04) from 42 trials. Mortality results were statistically significant when limited to trials in which participants (N = 2461) were defined as undernourished (RR 0.79, 95% CI 0.64 to 0.97).The risk of complications was reduced in 24 trials (RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.75 to 0.99). Few trials were able to suggest any functional benefit from supplementation. The WMD for length of stay from 12 trials also showed no statistically significant effect (-0.8 days, 95% CI -2.8 to 1.3). Adverse effects included nausea or diarrhoea.Authors' conclusions: Supplementation produces a small but consistent weight gain in older people. Mortality may be reduced in older people who are undernourished. There may also be a beneficial effect on complications which needs to be confirmed. However, this updated review found no evidence of improvement in functional benefit or reduction in length of hospital stay with supplements. Additional data from large-scale multi-centre trials are still required.US: http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD003288.pub3/abstractRecord #129 of 271ID: CD002891AU: Pratt Belinda MAU: Woolfenden SusanTI: Interventions for preventing eating disorders in children and adolescentsSO: Cochrane Database of Systematic ReviewsYR: 2002NO: 2PB: John Wiley & Sons, LtdKY: Feeding and Eating Disorders [prevention & control] [psychology];Program Evaluation;Psychotherapy;Adolescent[checkword];Child[checkword];Humans[checkword]CC: DEPRESSNDOI: 10.1002/14651858.CD002891AB: Background: Eating disorders represent an extremely difficult, time-consuming and costly condition to treat. Being young, female, and dieting are some of the few identified risk factors that have been reliably linked to the development of eating disorders. There is currently limited evidence in the published literature to suggest that any particular type of program is effective in preventing eating disorders and there has been concern that some interventions have the potential to cause harm.Objectives: To determine if eating disorder prevention programs for children and adolescents are effective in: (1) promoting healthy eating attitudes and behaviours; (2) promoting protective psychological factors; (3) promoting satisfactory physical health; (4) having a long-term, sustainable, and positive impact on mental and physical health; and, (5) ensuring safety in relation to possible harmful consequences on mental or physical health.Search methods: Relevant trials are identified through searching the Cochrane Controlled Trial Register (CCTR) and relevant biomedical and social science databases, as well as reference lists from articles identified through the search strategy and contact with experts in the field.Selection criteria: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) with a major focus on eating disorder prevention programs for children and adolescents, where there is no known DSM-IV diagnosis of an eating disorder, are eligible for inclusion in the review. Trials must include a control group and at least one objective outcome measure (e.g., BMI) or a standardised psychological measure used with the intervention and control group, pre- and post-intervention.Data collection and analysis: A total of 1016 titles have been identified through the search to date. Twenty-two studies were located that reported use of a randomised controlled trial methodology and were critically appraised by two independent reviewers. Twelve studies met the selection criteria outlined above.Main results: Combined data from two eating disorder prevention programs based on a media literacy and advocacy approach indicate a reduction in the internalisation or acceptance of societal ideals relating to appearance at a 3- to 6-month follow-up (Kusel 1999; Neumark* 2000) [SMD -0.28, -0.51 to -0.05, 95% CI]. There is insufficient evidence to support the effect of five programs designed to address eating attitudes and behaviours and other adolescent issues in the general community or those classified as being at high risk for eating disorder (Buddeberg* 1998; Dalle Grave 2001; Killen 1993; Santonastaso 1999; Zanetti 1999) and insufficient evidence to support the effect of two programs designed to improve self-esteem (O'Dea 2000; Wade 2003). Data from two didactic eating disorder awareness programs could not be pooled for analysis. There is not sufficient evidence to suggest that harm resulted from any of the prevention programs included in the review.Authors' conclusions: The one significant pooled effect in the current review does not allow for any firm conclusions to be made about the impact of prevention programs for eating disorders in children and adolescents, although none of the pooled comparisons indicated evidence of harm. The meta-analysis is in the process of being revised to account for the impact of cluster randomised trials.US: http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD002891/abstractRecord #130 of 271ID: CD011507AU: Crawford Tineke JAU: Crowther Caroline AAU: Alsweiler JaneAU: Brown JulieTI: Antenatal dietary supplementation with myo-inositol in women during pregnancy for preventing gestational diabetesSO: Cochrane Database of Systematic ReviewsYR: 2015NO: 12PB: John Wiley & Sons, LtdKY: Prenatal Care;Diabetes, Gestational [epidemiology] [prevention & control];Incidence;Inositol [adverse effects] [chemistry] [therapeutic use];Isomerism;Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic;Female[checkword];Humans[checkword];Pregnancy[checkword]CC: PREGDOI: 10.1002/14651858.CD011507.pub2AB: Background: Gestational diabetes, glucose intolerance with onset or first recognition during pregnancy, is a rising problem worldwide. Both non-pharmacological and pharmacological approaches to the prevention of gestational diabetes have been, and continue to be explored. Myo-inositol, an isomer of inositol, is a naturally occurring sugar commonly found in cereals, corn, legumes and meat. It is one of the intracellular mediators of the insulin signal and correlated with insulin sensitivity in type 2 diabetes. The potential beneficial effect on improving insulin sensitivity suggests that myo-inositol may be useful for women in preventing gestational diabetes.Objectives: To assess if antenatal dietary supplementation with myo-inositol is safe and effective, for the mother and fetus, in preventing gestational diabetes.Search methods: We searched the Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register, ClinicalTrials.gov, WHO ICTRP (2 November 2015) and reference lists of retrieved studies.Selection criteria: We sought published and unpublished randomised controlled trials, including conference abstracts, assessing the effects of myo-inositol for the prevention of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). Quasi-randomised and cross-over trials were not eligible for inclusion, but cluster designs were eligible. Participants in the trials were pregnant women. Women with pre-existing type 1 or type 2 diabetes were excluded. Trials that compared the administration of any dose of myo-inositol, alone or in a combination preparation were eligible for inclusion. Trials that used no treatment, placebo or another intervention as the comparator were eligible for inclusion.Data collection and analysis: Two review authors independently assessed trials for inclusion, risk of bias and extracted the data. Data were checked for accuracy.Main results: We included four randomised controlled trials (all conducted in Italy) reporting on 567 women who were less than 11 weeks' to 24 weeks' pregnant at the start of the trials. The trials had small sample sizes and one trial only reported an interim analysis. Two trials were open-label. The overall risk of bias was unclear.For the mother, supplementation with myo-inositol was associated with a reduction in the incidence of gestational diabetes compared with control (risk ratio (RR) 0.43, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.29 to 0.64; three trials; n = 502 women). Using GRADE methods this evidence was assessed as low with downgrading due to unclear risk of bias for allocation concealment in two of the included trials and lack of generalisability of findings. For women who received myo-inositol supplementation, the incidence of GDM ranged from 8% to 18%; for women in the control group, the incidence of GDM was 28%, using International Association of Diabetes and Pregnancy Study Groups Consensus Panel 2010 criteria to diagnose GDM.Two trials reported on hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, a primary maternal outcome of this review. There was no clear difference in risk of hypertensive disorders of pregnancy between the myo-inositol and control groups (average RR 0.43, 95% CI 0.02 to 8.41; two trials; n = 398 women; Tau2 = 3.23; I2 = 69%). Using GRADE methods, this evidence was assessed as very low, with downgrading due to wide confidence intervals with very low event rates, a small sample size, and lack of blinding and unclear allocation concealment methods, and a lack of generalisability. For women who received myo-inositol the risk of hypertensive disorders of pregnancy ranged from 0% to 33%; for women in the control group the risk was 4%.For the infant, none of the included trials reported on the primary neonatal outcomes of this systematic review (large-for-gestational age, perinatal mortality, mortality or morbidity composite).In terms of this review's secondary outcomes, there was no clear difference in the risk of caesarean section between the myo-inositol and control groups (RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.76 to 1.19; two trials; n = 398 women). Using GRADE methods, this evidence was assessed as low, with downgrading due to unclear risk of bias in one trial and lack of generalisability. For women who received myo-inositol supplementation, the risk of having a caesarean section ranged from 34% to 54%; for women in the control group the was 45%. There were no maternal adverse effects of therapy in the two trials that reported on this outcome (the other two trials did not report this outcome).Two trials found no clear difference in the risk of macrosomia between infants whose mothers received myo-inositol supplementation compared with controls (average RR 0.35, 95% CI 0.02 to 6.37; two trials; n = 398 infants;Tau2 = 3.33; I2 = 73%). Similarly, there was no clear difference between groups in terms of neonatal hypoglycaemia (RR 0.36, 95% CI 0.01 to 8.66) or shoulder dystocia (average RR 2.33, 95% CI 0.12 to 44.30, Tau2 = 3.24; I2 = 72%).There was a lack of data available for a large number of maternal and neonatal secondary outcomes, and no data for any of the long-term childhood or adulthood outcomes, or for health service cost outcomes.Authors' conclusions: Evidence from four trials of antenatal dietary supplementation with myo-inositol during pregnancy shows a potential benefit for reducing the incidence of gestational diabetes. No data were reported for any of this review's primary neonatal outcomes. There were very little outcome data for the majority of this review's secondary outcomes. There is no clear evidence of a difference for macrosomia when compared with control.The current evidence is based on small trials that are not powered to detect differences in outcomes including perinatal mortality and serious infant morbidity. All of the included studies were conducted in Italy which raises concerns about the lack of generalisability of the evidence to other settings. There is evidence of inconsistency and indirectness and as a result, many of the judgements on the quality of the evidence were downgraded to low or very low quality (GRADEpro Guideline Development Tool).Further trials for this promising antenatal intervention for preventing gestational diabetes are encouraged and should include pregnant women of different ethnicities and varying risk factors and use of myo-inositol (different doses, frequency and timing of administration) in comparison with placebo, diet and exercise or pharmacological interventions. Outcomes should include potential harms including adverse effects.US: http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD011507.pub2/abstractRecord #131 of 271ID: CD009951AU: Barrett Helen LAU: Dekker Nitert MarloesAU: Conwell Louise SAU: Callaway Leonie KTI: Probiotics for preventing gestational diabetesSO: Cochrane Database of Systematic ReviewsYR: 2014NO: 2PB: John Wiley & Sons, LtdKY: Diabetes, Gestational [prevention & control];Probiotics [therapeutic use];Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic;Female[checkword];Humans[checkword];Pregnancy[checkword]DOI: 10.1002/14651858.CD009951.pub2AB: Background: Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is associated with a range of adverse pregnancy outcomes for mother and infant. The prevention of GDM using lifestyle interventions has proven difficult. The gut microbiome (the composite of bacteria present in the intestines) influences host inflammatory pathways, glucose and lipid metabolism and, in other settings, alteration of the gut microbiome has been shown to impact on these host responses. Probiotics are one way of altering the gut microbiome but little is known about their use in influencing the metabolic environment of pregnancy.Objectives: To assess the effects of probiotic supplementation when compared with other methods for the prevention of GDM.Search methods: We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and childbirth Group's Trials Register (31 August 2013) and reference lists of the articles of retrieved studies.Selection criteria: Randomised and cluster-randomised trials comparing the use of probiotic supplementation with other methods for the prevention of the development of GDM. Cluster-randomised trials were eligible for inclusion but none were identified. Quasi-randomised and cross-over design studies are not eligible for inclusion in this review. Studies presented only as abstracts with no subsequent full report of study results would also have been excluded.Data collection and analysis: Two review authors independently assessed study eligibility, extracted data and assessed risk of bias of included study. Data were checked for accuracy.Main results: Eleven reports (relating to five possible trials) were found. We included one study (six trial reports) involving 256 women. Four other studies are ongoing.The included trial consisted of three treatment arms: probiotic with dietary intervention, placebo and dietary intervention, and dietary intervention alone; it was at a low risk of bias. The study reported primary outcomes of a reduction in the rate of gestational diabetes mellitus (risk ratio (RR) 0.38, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.20 to 0.70), with no statistical difference in the rates of miscarriage/intrauterine fetal death (IUFD)/stillbirth/neonatal death (RR 2.00, 95% CI 0.35 to 11.35). Secondary outcomes reported were a reduction in infant birthweight (mean difference (MD) -127.71 g, 95% CI -251.37 to -4.06) in the probiotic group and no clear evidence of increased risk of preterm delivery (RR 3.27, 95% CI 0.44 to 24.43), or caesarean section rate (RR 1.23, 95% CI 0.65 to 2.32). The primary infant outcomes of rates of macrosomia and large-for-gestational age infants were not reported. The following secondary outcomes were not reported: maternal gestational weight gain, pre-eclampsia, and the long-term diagnosis of diabetes mellitus; infant body composition, shoulder dystocia, admission to neonatal intensive care, jaundice, hypoglycaemia and long-term rates of obesity and diabetes mellitus.Authors' conclusions: One trial has shown a reduction in the rate of GDM when women are randomised to probiotics early in pregnancy but more uncertain evidence of any effect on miscarriage/IUFD/stillbirth/neonatal death. There are no data on macrosomia. At this time, there are insufficient studies to perform a quantitative meta-analysis. Further results are awaited from four ongoing studies.US: http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD009951.pub2/abstractRecord #132 of 271ID: CD005148AU: Faulkner GuyAU: Cohn TonyAU: Remington GaryTI: Interventions to reduce weight gain in schizophreniaSO: Cochrane Database of Systematic ReviewsYR: 2007NO: 1PB: John Wiley & Sons, LtdKY: Weight Gain;Weight Loss;Obesity [diet therapy] [therapy];Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic;Schizophrenia [complications] [drug therapy];Humans[checkword]CC: SCHIZDOI: 10.1002/14651858.CD005148.pub2AB: Background: Weight gain is common for people with schizophrenia and this has serious implications for health and well being.Objectives: To determine the effects of both pharmacological (excluding medication switching) and non pharmacological strategies for reducing or preventing weight gain in people with schizophrenia.Search methods: We searched key databases and the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group's trials register (April 2006), reference sections within relevant papers, hand searched key journals, and contacted the first author of each relevant study and other experts to collect further information.Selection criteria: We included all clinical randomised controlled trials comparing any pharmacological or non pharmacological intervention for weight gain (diet and exercise counselling) with standard care or other treatments for people with schizophrenia or schizophrenia-like illnesses.Data collection and analysis: We reliably selected, quality assessed and extracted data from studies. As weight is a continuous outcome measurement, weighted mean differences (WMD) of the change from baseline were calculated. The primary outcome measure was weight loss.Main results: Twenty-three randomised controlled trials met the inclusion criteria for this review. Five trials assessed a cognitive/behavioural intervention and eighteen assessed a pharmacological adjunct. In terms of prevention, two cognitive/behavioural trials showed significant treatment effect (mean weight change) at end of treatment (n=104, 2 RCTs, WMD -3.38 kg CI -4.2 to -2.0). Pharmacological adjunct treatments were significant with a modest prevention of weight gain (n=274, 6 RCTs, WMD - 1.16 kg CI -1.9 to -0.4). In terms of treatments for weight loss, we found significantly greater weight reduction in the cognitive behavioural intervention group (n=129, 3 RCTs, WMD -1.69 kg CI -2.8 to -0.6) compared with standard care.Authors' conclusions: Modest weight loss can be achieved with selective pharmacological and non pharmacological interventions. However, interpretation is limited by the small number of studies, small sample size, short study duration and by variability of the interventions themselves, their intensity and duration. Future studies adequately powered, with longer treatment duration and rigorous methodology will be needed in further evaluating the efficacy and safety of weight loss interventions for moderating weight gain. At this stage, there is insufficient evidence to support the general use of pharmacological interventions for weight management in people with schizophrenia.US: http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD005148.pub2/abstractRecord #133 of 271ID: CD010015AU: Lawrenson John GAU: Evans Jennifer RTI: Omega 3 fatty acids for preventing or slowing the progression of age-related macular degenerationSO: Cochrane Database of Systematic ReviewsYR: 2015NO: 4PB: John Wiley & Sons, LtdKY: Disease Progression;Fatty Acids, Omega-3 [adverse effects] [therapeutic use];Macular Degeneration [prevention & control];Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic;Humans[checkword]DOI: 10.1002/14651858.CD010015.pub3AB: Background: Evidence from animal models and observational studies in humans has suggested that there is an inverse relationship between dietary intake of omega 3 long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LCPUFA) and risk of developing age-related macular degeneration (AMD) or progression to advanced AMD.Objectives: To review the evidence that increasing the levels of omega 3 LCPUFA in the diet (either by eating more foods rich in omega 3 or by taking nutritional supplements) prevents AMD or slows the progression of AMD.Search methods: We searched CENTRAL (which contains the Cochrane Eyes and Vision Group Trials Register) (2015, Issue 1), Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid MEDLINE In-Process and Other Non-Indexed Citations, Ovid MEDLINE Daily, Ovid OLDMEDLINE (January 1946 to February 2015), EMBASE (January 1980 to February 2015), Latin American and Caribbean Health Sciences Literature Database (LILACS) (January 1982 to February 2015), the ISRCTN registry (www.isrctn.com/editAdvancedSearch), ClinicalTrials.gov (www.clinicaltrials.gov) and the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) (www.who.int/ictrp/search/en). We did not use any date or language restrictions in the electronic searches for trials. We last searched the electronic databases on 2 February 2015.Selection criteria: We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) where increased dietary intake of omega 3 LCPUFA was compared to placebo or no intervention with the aim of preventing the development of AMD, or slowing its progression.Data collection and analysis: Both authors independently selected studies, assessed them for risk of bias and extracted data. One author entered data into RevMan 5 and the other author checked the data entry. We conducted a meta-analysis for one primary outcome, progression of AMD, using a fixed-effect inverse variance model.Main results: We included two RCTs in this review, in which 2343 participants with AMD were randomised to receive either omega 3 fatty acid supplements or a placebo. The trials, which had a low risk of bias, were conducted in the USA and France. Overall, there was no evidence that people who took omega 3 fatty acid supplements were at decreased (or increased risk) of progression to advanced AMD (pooled hazard ratio (HR) 0.96, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.84 to 1.10, high quality evidence). Similarly, people taking these supplements were no more (or less) likely to lose 15 or more letters of visual acuity (USA study HR 0.96, 95% CI 0.84 to 1.10; French study at 36 months risk ratio (RR) 1.25, 95% CI 0.69 to 2.26, participants = 230). The number of adverse events was similar in the intervention and placebo groups (USA study participants with one or more serious adverse event RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.09, participants = 2080; French study total adverse events RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.97 to 1.13, participants = 263).Authors' conclusions: This review found that omega 3 LCPUFA supplementation in people with AMD for periods up to five years does not reduce the risk of progression to advanced AMD or the development of moderate to severe visual loss. No published randomised trials were identified on dietary omega 3 fatty acids for primary prevention of AMD. Currently available evidence does not support increasing dietary intake of omega 3 LCPUFA for the explicit purpose of preventing or slowing the progression of AMD.US: http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD010015.pub3/abstractRecord #134 of 271ID: CD011683AU: Mosdøl AnnhildAU: Lidal Ingeborg BAU: Straumann Gyri HAU: Vist Gunn ETI: Targeted mass media interventions promoting healthy behaviours to reduce risk of non-communicable diseases in adult, ethnic minoritiesSO: Cochrane Database of Systematic ReviewsYR: 2017NO: 2PB: John Wiley & Sons, LtdDOI: 10.1002/14651858.CD011683.pub2AB: Background: Physical activity, a balanced diet, avoidance of tobacco exposure, and limited alcohol consumption may reduce morbidity and mortality from non-communicable diseases (NCDs). Mass media interventions are commonly used to encourage healthier behaviours in population groups. It is unclear whether targeted mass media interventions for ethnic minority groups are more or less effective in changing behaviours than those developed for the general population.Objectives: To determine the effects of mass media interventions targeting adult ethnic minorities with messages about physical activity, dietary patterns, tobacco use or alcohol consumption to reduce the risk of NCDs.Search methods: We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, CINAHL, ERIC, SweMed+, and ISI Web of Science until August 2016. We also searched for grey literature in OpenGrey, Grey Literature Report, Eldis, and two relevant websites until October 2016. The searches were not restricted by language.Selection criteria: We searched for individual and cluster-randomised controlled trials, controlled before-and-after studies (CBA) and interrupted time series studies (ITS). Relevant interventions promoted healthier behaviours related to physical activity, dietary patterns, tobacco use or alcohol consumption; were disseminated via mass media channels; and targeted ethnic minority groups. The population of interest comprised adults (≥ 18 years) from ethnic minority groups in the focal countries. Primary outcomes included indicators of behavioural change, self-reported behavioural change and knowledge and attitudes towards change. Secondary outcomes were the use of health promotion services and costs related to the project.Data collection and analysis: Two authors independently reviewed the references to identify studies for inclusion. We extracted data and assessed the risk of bias in all included studies. We did not pool the results due to heterogeneity in comparisons made, outcomes, and study designs. We describe the results narratively and present them in 'Summary of findings' tables. We judged the quality of the evidence using the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation) methodology.Main results: Six studies met the inclusion criteria, including three RCTs, two cluster-RCTs and one ITS. All were conducted in the USA and comprised targeted mass media interventions for people of African descent (four studies), Spanish-language dominant Latino immigrants (one study), and Chinese immigrants (one study). The two latter studies offered the intervention in the participants’ first language (Spanish, Cantonese, or Mandarin). Three interventions targeted towards women only, one pregnant women specifically. We judged all studies as being at unclear risk of bias in at least one domain and three studies as being at high risk of bias in at least one domain.We categorised the findings into three comparisons. The first comparison examined mass media interventions targeted at ethnic minorities versus an equivalent mass media intervention intended for the general population. The one study in this category (255 participants of African decent) found little or no difference in effect on self-reported behavioural change for smoking and only small differences in attitudes to change between participants who were given a culturally specific smoking cessation booklet versus a booklet intended for the general population. We are uncertain about the effect estimates, as assessed by the GRADE methodology (very low quality evidence of effect). No study provided data for indicators of behavioural change or adverse effects.The second comparison assessed targeted mass media interventions versus no intervention. One study (154 participants of African decent) reported effects for our primary outcomes. Participants in the intervention group had access to 12 one-hour live programmes on cable TV and received print material over three months regarding nutrition and physical activity to improve health and weight control. Change in body mass index (BMI) was comparable between groups 12 months after the baseline (low quality evidence). Scores on a food habits (fat behaviours) and total leisure activity scores changed favourably for the intervention group (very low quality evidence). Two other studies exposed entire populations in geographical areas to radio advertisements targeted towards African American communities. Authors presented effects on two of our secondary outcomes, use of health promotion services and project costs. The campaign message was to call smoking quit lines. The outcome was the number of calls received. After one year, one study reported 18 calls per estimated 10,000 targeted smokers from the intervention communities (estimated target population 310,500 persons), compared to 0.2 calls per estimated 10,000 targeted smokers from the control communities (estimated target population 331,400 persons) (moderate quality evidence). The ITS study also reported an increase in the number of calls from the target population during campaigns (low quality evidence). The proportion of African American callers increased in both studies (low to very low quality evidence). No study provided data on knowledge and attitudes for change and adverse effects. Information on costs were sparse.The third comparison assessed targeted mass media interventions versus a mass media intervention plus personalised content. Findings are based on three studies (1361 participants). Participants in these comparison groups received personal feedback. Two of the studies recorded weight changes over time. Neither found significant differences between the groups (low quality evidence). Evidence on behavioural changes, and knowledge and attitudes typically found some effects in favour of receiving personalised content or no significant differences between groups (very low quality evidence). No study provided data on adverse effects. Information on costs were sparse.Authors' conclusions: The available evidence is inadequate for understanding whether mass media interventions targeted toward ethnic minority populations are more effective in changing health behaviours than mass media interventions intended for the population at large. When compared to no intervention, a targeted mass media intervention may increase the number of calls to smoking quit line, but the effect on health behaviours is unclear. These studies could not distinguish the impact of different components, for instance the effect of hearing a message regarding behavioural change, the cultural adaptation to the ethnic minority group, or increase reach to the target group through more appropriate mass media channels. New studies should explore targeted interventions for ethnic minorities with a first language other than the dominant language in their resident country, as well as directly compare targeted versus general population mass media interventions.US: http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD011683.pub2/abstractRecord #135 of 271ID: CD001141AU: McFadden AlisonAU: Gavine AnnaAU: Renfrew Mary JAU: Wade AngelaAU: Buchanan PhyllAU: Taylor Jane LAU: Veitch EmmaAU: Rennie Anne MarieAU: Crowther Susan AAU: Neiman SaraAU: MacGillivray StephenTI: Support for healthy breastfeeding mothers with healthy term babiesSO: Cochrane Database of Systematic ReviewsYR: 2017NO: 2PB: John Wiley & Sons, LtdKY: Breast Feeding;Social Support;Health Education [methods];Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic;Term Birth;Female[checkword];Humans[checkword];Infant[checkword]DOI: 10.1002/14651858.CD001141.pub5AB: Background: There is extensive evidence of important health risks for infants and mothers related to not breastfeeding. In 2003, the World Health Organization recommended that infants be breastfed exclusively until six months of age, with breastfeeding continuing as an important part of the infant’s diet until at least two years of age. However, current breastfeeding rates in many countries do not reflect this recommendation.Objectives: To describe forms of breastfeeding support which have been evaluated in controlled studies, the timing of the interventions and the settings in which they have been used.To examine the effectiveness of different modes of offering similar supportive interventions (for example, whether the support offered was proactive or reactive, face-to-face or over the telephone), and whether interventions containing both antenatal and postnatal elements were more effective than those taking place in the postnatal period alone.To examine the effectiveness of different care providers and (where information was available) training.To explore the interaction between background breastfeeding rates and effectiveness of support.Search methods: We searched Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth's Trials Register (29 February 2016) and reference lists of retrieved studies.Selection criteria: Randomised or quasi-randomised controlled trials comparing extra support for healthy breastfeeding mothers of healthy term babies with usual maternity care.Data collection and analysis: Two review authors independently assessed trials for inclusion and risk of bias, extracted data and checked them for accuracy. The quality of the evidence was assessed using the GRADE approach.Main results: This updated review includes 100 trials involving more than 83,246 mother-infant pairs of which 73 studies contribute data (58 individually-randomised trials and 15 cluster-randomised trials). We considered that the overall risk of bias of trials included in the review was mixed. Of the 31 new studies included in this update, 21 provided data for one or more of the primary outcomes. The total number of mother-infant pairs in the 73 studies that contributed data to this review is 74,656 (this total was 56,451 in the previous version of this review). The 73 studies were conducted in 29 countries. Results of the analyses continue to confirm that all forms of extra support analyzed together showed a decrease in cessation of 'any breastfeeding', which includes partial and exclusive breastfeeding (average risk ratio (RR) for stopping any breastfeeding before six months 0.91, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.88 to 0.95; moderate-quality evidence, 51 studies) and for stopping breastfeeding before four to six weeks (average RR 0.87, 95% CI 0.80 to 0.95; moderate-quality evidence, 33 studies). All forms of extra support together also showed a decrease in cessation of exclusive breastfeeding at six months (average RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.85 to 0.92; moderate-quality evidence, 46 studies) and at four to six weeks (average RR 0.79, 95% CI 0.71 to 0.89; moderate quality, 32 studies). We downgraded evidence to moderate-quality due to very high heterogeneity.We investigated substantial heterogeneity for all four outcomes with subgroup analyses for the following covariates: who delivered care, type of support, timing of support, background breastfeeding rate and number of postnatal contacts. Covariates were not able to explain heterogeneity in general. Though the interaction tests were significant for some analyses, we advise caution in the interpretation of results for subgroups due to the heterogeneity. Extra support by both lay and professionals had a positive impact on breastfeeding outcomes. Several factors may have also improved results for women practising exclusive breastfeeding, such as interventions delivered with a face-to-face component, high background initiation rates of breastfeeding, lay support, and a specific schedule of four to eight contacts. However, because within-group heterogeneity remained high for all of these analyses, we advise caution when making specific conclusions based on subgroup results. We noted no evidence for subgroup differences for the any breastfeeding outcomes.Authors' conclusions: When breastfeeding support is offered to women, the duration and exclusivity of breastfeeding is increased. Characteristics of effective support include: that it is offered as standard by trained personnel during antenatal or postnatal care, that it includes ongoing scheduled visits so that women can predict when support will be available, and that it is tailored to the setting and the needs of the population group. Support is likely to be more effective in settings with high initiation rates. Support may be offered either by professional or lay/peer supporters, or a combination of both. Strategies that rely mainly on face-to-face support are more likely to succeed with women practising exclusive breastfeeding.US: http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD001141.pub5/abstractRecord #136 of 271ID: CD007635AU: Spanjersberg Willem RAU: Reurings JurrianAU: Keus FrederikAU: van Laarhoven Cornelis JHMTI: Fast track surgery versus conventional recovery strategies for colorectal surgerySO: Cochrane Database of Systematic ReviewsYR: 2011NO: 2PB: John Wiley & Sons, LtdKY: Colonic Diseases [surgery];Early Ambulation;Length of Stay;Pain, Postoperative [drug therapy];Patient Readmission [statistics & numerical data];Postoperative Care [adverse effects] [methods] [mortality];Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic;Recovery of Function;Rectal Diseases [surgery];Humans[checkword]CC: COLOCADOI: 10.1002/14651858.CD007635.pub2AB: Background: In recent years the Enhanced Recovery after Surgery (ERAS) postoperative pathway in (ileo-)colorectal surgery, aiming at improving perioperative care and decreasing postoperative complications, has become more common.Objectives: We investigated the effectiveness and safety of the ERAS multimodal strategy, compared to conventional care after (ileo-)colorectal surgery. The primary research question was whether ERAS protocols lead to less morbidity and secondary whether length of stay was reduced.Search methods: To answer the research question we entered search strings containing keywords like "fast track", "colorectal and surgery" and "enhanced recovery" into major databases. We also hand searched references in identified reviews concerning ERAS.Selection criteria: We included published randomised clinical trials, in any language, comparing ERAS to conventional treatment in patients with (ileo-) colorectal disease requiring a resection. RCT's including at least 7 ERAS items in the ERAS group and no more than 2 in the conventional arm were included.Data collection and analysis: Data of included trials were independently extracted by the reviewers. Analyses were performed using "REVMAN 5.0.22". Data were pooled and rate differences as well as weighted mean differences with their 95% confidence intervals were calculated using either fixed or random effects models, depending on heterogeneity (I2).Main results: 4 RCTs were included and analysed. Methodological quality of included studies was considered low, when scored according to GRADE methodology. Total numbers of inclusion were limited. The trials included in primary analysis reported 237 patients, (119 ERAS vs 118 conventional). Baseline characteristics were comparable. The primary outcome measure, complications, showed a significant risk reduction for all complications (RR 0.50; 95% CI 0.35 to 0.72). This difference was not due to reduction in major complications. Length of hospital stay was significantly reduced in the ERAS group (MD -2.94 days; 95% CI -3.69 to -2.19), and readmission rates were equal in both groups. Other outcome parameters were unsuitable for meta-analysis, but seemed to favour ERAS.Authors' conclusions: The quantity and especially quality of data are low. Analysis shows a reduction in overall complications, but major complications were not reduced. Length of stay was reduced significantly. We state that ERAS seems safe, but the quality of trials and lack of sufficient other outcome parameters do not justify implementation of ERAS as the standard of care. Within ERAS protocols included, no answer regarding the role for minimally invasive surgery (i.e. laparoscopy) was found. Furthermore, protocol compliance within ERAS programs has not been investigated, while this seems a known problem in the field. Therefore, more specific and large RCT's are needed.US: http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD007635.pub2/abstractRecord #137 of 271ID: CD001939AU: Gluud Lise LotteAU: Dam GitteAU: Les IñigoAU: Córdoba JuanAU: Marchesini GiulioAU: Borre MetteAU: Aagaard Niels KristianAU: Vilstrup HendrikTI: Branched-chain amino acids for people with hepatic encephalopathySO: Cochrane Database of Systematic ReviewsYR: 2015NO: 9PB: John Wiley & Sons, LtdKY: Administration, Oral;Amino Acids, Branched-Chain [adverse effects] [therapeutic use];Bias (Epidemiology);Diarrhea [etiology];Hepatic Encephalopathy [drug therapy] [mortality];Injections, Intravenous;Nausea [etiology];Quality of Life;Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic;Female[checkword];Humans[checkword];Male[checkword]CC: LIVERDOI: 10.1002/14651858.CD001939.pub3AB: Background: Hepatic encephalopathy is a brain dysfunction with neurological and psychiatric changes associated with liver insufficiency or portal-systemic shunting. The severity ranges from minor symptoms to coma. A Cochrane systematic review including 11 randomised clinical trials on branched-chain amino acids (BCAA) versus control interventions has evaluated if BCAA may benefit people with hepatic encephalopathy.Objectives: To evaluate the beneficial and harmful effects of BCAA versus any control intervention for people with hepatic encephalopathy.Search methods: We identified trials through manual and electronic searches in The Cochrane Hepato-Biliary Group Controlled Trials Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Science Citation Index (August 2015).Selection criteria: We included randomised clinical trials, irrespective of the bias control, language, or publication status.Data collection and analysis: The authors independently extracted data based on published reports and collected data from the primary investigators. We changed our primary outcomes in this update of the review to include mortality (all cause), hepatic encephalopathy (number of people without improved manifestations of hepatic encephalopathy), and adverse events. The analyses included random-effects and fixed-effect meta-analyses. We performed subgroup, sensitivity, regression, and trial sequential analyses to evaluate sources of heterogeneity (including intervention, and participant and trial characteristics), bias (using The Cochrane Hepato-Biliary Group method), small-study effects, and the robustness of the results after adjusting for sparse data and multiplicity. We graded the quality of the evidence using the GRADE approach.Main results: We found 16 randomised clinical trials including 827 participants with hepatic encephalopathy classed as overt (12 trials) or minimal (four trials). Eight trials assessed oral BCAA supplements and seven trials assessed intravenous BCAA. The control groups received placebo/no intervention (two trials), diets (10 trials), lactulose (two trials), or neomycin (two trials). In 15 trials, all participants had cirrhosis. We classed seven trials as low risk of bias and nine trials as high risk of bias (mainly due to lack of blinding or for-profit funding). In a random-effects meta-analysis of mortality, we found no difference between BCAA and controls (risk ratio (RR) 0.88, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.69 to 1.11; 760 participants; 15 trials; moderate quality of evidence). We found no evidence of small-study effects. Sensitivity analyses of trials with a low risk of bias found no beneficial or detrimental effect of BCAA on mortality. Trial sequential analysis showed that the required information size was not reached, suggesting that additional evidence was needed. BCAA had a beneficial effect on hepatic encephalopathy (RR 0.73, 95% CI 0.61 to 0.88; 827 participants; 16 trials; high quality of evidence). We found no small-study effects and confirmed the beneficial effect of BCAA in a sensitivity analysis that only included trials with a low risk of bias (RR 0.71, 95% CI 0.52 to 0.96). The trial sequential analysis showed that firm evidence was reached. In a fixed-effect meta-analysis, we found that BCAA increased the risk of nausea and vomiting (RR 5.56; 2.93 to 10.55; moderate quality of evidence). We found no beneficial or detrimental effects of BCAA on nausea or vomiting in a random-effects meta-analysis or on quality of life or nutritional parameters. We did not identify predictors of the intervention effect in the subgroup, sensitivity, or meta-regression analyses. In sensitivity analyses that excluded trials with a lactulose or neomycin control, BCAA had a beneficial effect on hepatic encephalopathy (RR 0.76, 95% CI 0.63 to 0.92). Additional sensitivity analyses found no difference between BCAA and lactulose or neomycin (RR 0.66, 95% CI 0.34 to 1.30).Authors' conclusions: In this updated review, we included five additional trials. The analyses showed that BCAA had a beneficial effect on hepatic encephalopathy. We found no effect on mortality, quality of life, or nutritional parameters, but we need additional trials to evaluate these outcomes. Likewise, we need additional randomised clinical trials to determine the effect of BCAA compared with interventions such as non-absorbable disaccharides, rifaximin, or other antibiotics.US: http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD001939.pub3/abstractRecord #138 of 271ID: CD007296AU: Gregorio Germana VAU: Dans Leonila FAU: Silvestre Maria AsuncionTI: Early versus Delayed Refeeding for Children with Acute DiarrhoeaSO: Cochrane Database of Systematic ReviewsYR: 2011NO: 7PB: John Wiley & Sons, LtdKY: Eating;Fluid Therapy;Acute Disease;Developing Countries;Diarrhea [diet therapy] [therapy];Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic;Time Factors;Child[checkword];Child, Preschool[checkword];Humans[checkword];Infant[checkword]CC: INFECTNDOI: 10.1002/14651858.CD007296.pub2AB: Background: Acute diarrhoea is one of the principal causes of morbidity and mortality among children in low-income countries.  The cornerstone of treatment is oral rehydration therapy and dietary management.  However, there is a lack of data and studies on both the timing and type of feeding that should be adopted during the course of the illness.Objectives: To compare the efficacy and safety of early and late reintroduction of feeding in children with acute diarrhoea.Search methods: In May 2011, we searched the Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group Specialized Register, CENTRAL (The Cochrane Library 2011, Issue 1), MEDLINE, EMBASE, LILACS, and mRCT. We also contacted researchers and organizations, and searched reference lists.Selection criteria: Randomized controlled trials of early versus late refeeding among children less than 10 years old with acute diarrhoea.  Early refeeding was defined as within 12 hours of start of rehydration and late refeeding was defined as more than 12 hours after start of rehydration. Data collection and analysis: Two authors independently assessed the search results and the risk of bias, and extracted data. We present risk ratios for dichotomous outcomes and mean differences for continuous outcomes. We combined the results of the trials using meta-analysis when heterogeneity was not substantial.Main results: Twelve trials involving 1283 participants wereincluded; 1226 participants were used in the analysis (724 in the early refeeding group and 502 in the late refeeding group). Nine trials described their allocation sequence, but only two used concealed allocation. One trial reported single-blinding but did not clearly identify the person who was blinded. Early refeeding meant intake during or immediately after start of rehydration, while late refeeding meant intake only 20 hours to 48 hours after start of rehydration. Significant heterogeneity was noted in the data for the duration of diarrhoea. There was no significant difference between the two refeeding groups in the number of participants who needed unscheduled intravenous fluids (six trials with 813 participants), who experienced episodes of vomiting (five trials with 466 participants), and who developed persistent diarrhoea (four trials with 522 participants). The mean length of hospital stay was also similar (two trials with 246 participants).Authors' conclusions: There was no evidence that early refeeding increases the risk of unscheduled intravenous fluid use, episodes of vomiting, and development of persistent diarrhoea.

In view of the fact that seizures in people with intellectual disabilities are often complex and refractory to pharmacological interventions, it is evident that good quality randomised controlled trials (RCTs) are needed to assess the efficacy of alternatives or adjuncts to pharmacological interventions.This is an updated version of the original Cochrane review (Beavis 2007) published in The Cochrane Library (2007, Issue 4).Objectives: To assess data derived from randomised controlled trials of non-pharmacological interventions for people with epilepsy and intellectual disabilities.Non-pharmacological interventions include, but are not limited to, the following.• Surgical procedures.• Specialised diets, for example, the ketogenic diet, or vitamin and folic acid supplementation.• Psychological interventions for patients or for patients and carers/parents, for example, cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT), electroencephalographic (EEG) biofeedback and educational intervention.• Yoga.• Acupuncture.• Relaxation therapy (e.g. music therapy).Search methods: For the latest update of this review, we searched the Cochrane Epilepsy Group Specialised Register (19 August 2014), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) via CRSO (19 August 2014), MEDLINE (Ovid, 1946 to 19 August 2014) and PsycINFO (EBSCOhost, 1887 to 19 August 2014).Selection criteria: Randomised controlled trials of non-pharmacological interventions for people with epilepsy and intellectual disabilities.Data collection and analysis: Two review authors independently applied the inclusion criteria and extracted study data.Main results: One study is included in this review. When two surgical procedures were compared, results indicated that corpus callosotomy with anterior temporal lobectomy was more effective than anterior temporal lobectomy alone in improving quality of life and performance on IQ tests among people with epilepsy and intellectual disabilities. No evidence was found to support superior benefit in seizure control for either intervention. This is the only study of its kind and was rated as having an overall unclear risk of bias. The previous update (December 2010) identified one RCT in progress. The study authors have confirmed that they are aiming to publish by the end of 2015; therefore this study (Bjurulf 2008) has not been included in the current review.Authors' conclusions: This review highlights the need for well-designed randomised controlled trials conducted to assess the effects of non-pharmacological interventions on seizure and behavioural outcomes in people with intellectual disabilities and epilepsy.US: http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD005502.pub3/abstractRecord #140 of 271ID: CD010405AU: Flowers NadineAU: Hartley LouiseAU: Todkill DanielAU: Stranges SaverioAU: Rees KarenTI: Co-enzyme Q10 supplementation for the primary prevention of cardiovascular diseaseSO: Cochrane Database of Systematic ReviewsYR: 2014NO: 12PB: John Wiley & Sons, LtdKY: Antioxidants [administration & dosage];Cardiovascular Diseases [blood] [prevention & control];Cholesterol [blood];Hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA Reductase Inhibitors [administration & dosage];Lipids [blood];Primary Prevention [methods];Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic;Ubiquinone [administration & dosage] [analogs & derivatives];Humans[checkword]CC: VASCDOI: 10.1002/14651858.CD010405.pub2AB: Background: Cardiovascular disease (CVD) remains the number one cause of death and disability worldwide and public health interventions focus on modifiable risk factors, such as diet. Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) is an antioxidant that is naturally synthesised by the body and can also be taken as a dietary supplement. Studies have shown that a CoQ10 deficiency is associated with cardiovascular disease.Objectives: To determine the effects of coenzyme Q10 supplementation as a single ingredient for the primary prevention of CVD.Search methods: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL 2013, Issue 11); MEDLINE (Ovid, 1946 to November week 3 2013); EMBASE (Ovid, 1947 to 27 November 2013) and other relevant resources on 2 December 2013. We applied no language restrictions.Selection criteria: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) lasting at least three months involving healthy adults or those at high risk of CVD but without a diagnosis of CVD. Trials investigated the supplementation of CoQ10 alone as a single supplement. The comparison group was no intervention or placebo. The outcomes of interest were CVD clinical events and major CVD risk factors, adverse effects and costs. We excluded any trials involving multifactorial lifestyle interventions to avoid confounding.Data collection and analysis: Two authors independently selected trials for inclusion, abstracted data and assessed the risk of bias.We contacted authors for additional information where necessary.Main results: We identified six RCTs with a total of 218 participants randomised, one trial awaiting classification and five ongoing trials. All trials were conducted in participants at high risk of CVD, two trials examined CoQ10 supplementation alone and four examined CoQ10 supplementation in patients on statin therapy; we analysed these separately. All six trials were small-scale, recruiting between 20 and 52 participants; one trial was at high risk of bias for incomplete outcome data and one for selective reporting; all studies were unclear in the method of allocation and therefore for selection bias. The dose of CoQ10 varied between 100 mg/day and 200 mg/day and the duration of the interventions was similar at around three months.No studies reported mortality or non-fatal cardiovascular events. None of the included studies provided data on adverse events.Two trials examined the effect of CoQ10 on blood pressure. For systolic blood pressure we did not perform a meta-analysis due to significant heterogeneity. In one trial CoQ10 supplementation had no effect on systolic blood pressure (mean difference (MD) -1.90 mmHg, 95% confidence interval (CI) -13.17 to 9.37, 51 patients randomised). In the other trial there was a statistically significant reduction in systolic blood pressure (MD -15.00 mmHg, 95% CI -19.06 to -10.94, 20 patients randomised). For diastolic blood pressure we performed a random-effects meta-analysis, which showed no evidence of effect of CoQ10 supplementation when these two small trials were pooled (MD -1.62 mmHg, 95% CI -5.2 to 1.96).One trial (51 patients randomised) looked at the effect of CoQ10 on lipid levels. The trial showed no evidence of effect of CoQ10 supplementation on total cholesterol (MD 0.30 mmol/L, 95% CI -0.10 to 0.70), high-density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol (MD 0.02 mmol/L, 95% CI -0.13 to 0.17) or triglycerides (MD 0.05 mmol/L, 95% CI -0.42 to 0.52).Of the four trials that investigated CoQ10 supplementation in patients on statin therapy, three of them showed that simultaneous administration of CoQ10 did not significantly influence lipid levels or systolic blood pressure levels between the two groups. The fourth trial showed a significant increase in the change in total and low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol at three months across the four arms of the trial (α-tocopherol, CoQ10, CoQ10 + α-tocopherol and placebo), however the way in which the data were presented meant that we were unable to determine if there was any significant difference between the CoQ10 only and placebo arms. In contrast, there was no significant difference in the change in HDL-cholesterol and triglycerides after three months between the four arms of the trial.Authors' conclusions: There are very few studies to date examining CoQ10 for the primary prevention of CVD. The results from the ongoing studies will add to the evidence base. Due to the small number of underpowered trials contributing to the analyses, the results presented should be treated with caution and further high quality trials with longer-term follow-up are needed to determine the effects on cardiovascular events.US: http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD010405.pub2/abstractRecord #141 of 271ID: CD011523AU: Gurusamy Kurinchi SelvanAU: Pallari ElenaTI: Medical versus surgical treatment for refractory or recurrent peptic ulcerSO: Cochrane Database of Systematic ReviewsYR: 2016NO: 3PB: John Wiley & Sons, LtdKY: Antacids [therapeutic use];Histamine H2 Antagonists [therapeutic use];Peptic Ulcer [therapy];Recurrence;Stomach Neoplasms [diagnosis];Stomach Ulcer [drug therapy] [surgery];Treatment Failure;Humans[checkword]CC: UPPERGIDOI: 10.1002/14651858.CD011523.pub2AB: Background: Refractory peptic ulcers are ulcers in the stomach or duodenum that do not heal after eight to 12 weeks of medical treatment or those that are associated with complications despite medical treatment. Recurrent peptic ulcers are peptic ulcers that recur after healing of the ulcer. Given the number of deaths due to peptic ulcer-related complications and the long-term complications of medical treatment (increased incidence of fracture), it is unclear whether medical or surgical intervention is the better treatment option in people with recurrent or refractory peptic ulcers.Objectives: To assess the benefits and harms of medical versus surgical treatment for people with recurrent or refractory peptic ulcer.Search methods: We searched the specialised register of the Cochrane Upper GI and Pancreatic Diseases group, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) in the Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, EMBASE, Science Citation Index Expanded, and trials registers until September 2015 to identify randomised trials and non-randomised studies, using search strategies. We also searched the references of included studies to identify further studies.Selection criteria: We considered randomised controlled trials and non-randomised studies comparing medical treatment with surgical treatment in people with refractory or recurrent peptic ulcer, irrespective of language, blinding, or publication status for inclusion in the review.Data collection and analysis: Two review authors independently identified trials and extracted data. We planned to calculate the risk ratio, mean difference, standardised mean difference, or hazard ratio with 95% confidence intervals using both fixed-effect and random-effects models with Review Manager 5 based on intention-to-treat analysis.Main results: We included only one non-randomised study published 30 years ago in the review. This study included 77 participants who had gastric ulcer and in whom medical therapy (histamine H2 receptor blockers, antacids, and diet) had failed after an average duration of treatment of 29 months. The authors do not state whether these were recurrent or refractory ulcers. It appears that the participants did not have previous complications such as bleeding or perforation. Of the 77 included participants, 37 participants continued to have medical therapy while 40 participants received surgical therapy (antrectomy with or without vagotomy; subtotal gastrectomy with or without vagotomy; vagotomy; pyloroplasty and suture of the ulcer; suture or closure of ulcer without vagotomy or excision of the ulcer; proximal gastric or parietal cell vagotomy alone; suture or closure of the ulcer with proximal gastric or parietal cell vagotomy). Whether to use medical or surgical treatment was determined by participant's or treating physician's preference.The study authors reported that two participants in the medical treatment group (2 out of 37; 5.4%) had gastric cancer, which was identified by repeated biopsy. They did not report the proportion of participants who had gastric cancer in the surgical treatment group. They also did not report the implications of the delayed diagnosis of gastric cancer in the medical treatment group. They did not report any other outcomes of interest for this review (that is health-related quality of life (using any validated scale), adverse events and serious adverse events, peptic ulcer bleeding, peptic ulcer perforation, abdominal pain, and long-term mortality).Authors' conclusions: We found no studies that provide the relative benefits and harms of medical versus surgical treatment for recurrent or refractory peptic ulcers. Studies that evaluate the natural history of recurrent and refractory peptic ulcers are urgently required to determine whether randomised controlled trials comparing medical versus surgical management in patients with recurrent or refractory peptic ulcers or both are necessary. Such studies will also provide information for the design of such randomised controlled trials. A minimum follow-up of two to three years will allow the calculation of the incidence of complications and gastric cancer (in gastric ulcers only) in recurrent and refractory peptic ulcers. In addition to complications related to treatment and disease, health-related quality of life and loss of productivity should also be measured.US: http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD011523.pub2/abstractRecord #142 of 271ID: CD012436AU: Mead EmmaAU: Atkinson GregAU: Richter BerndAU: Metzendorf Maria-IntiAU: Baur LouiseAU: Finer NicholasAU: Corpeleijn EvaAU: O'Malley ClaireAU: Ells Louisa JTI: Drug interventions for the treatment of obesity in children and adolescentsSO: Cochrane Database of Systematic ReviewsYR: 2016NO: 11PB: John Wiley & Sons, LtdKY: Anti-Obesity Agents [adverse effects] [therapeutic use];Body Mass Index;Cyclobutanes [therapeutic use];Fluoxetine [therapeutic use];Lactones [therapeutic use];Metformin [therapeutic use];Pediatric Obesity [drug therapy];Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic;Adolescent[checkword];Child[checkword];Humans[checkword]DOI: 10.1002/14651858.CD012436AB: Background: Child and adolescent obesity has increased globally, and can be associated with significant short- and long-term health consequences.Objectives: To assess the efficacy of drug interventions for the treatment of obesity in children and adolescents.Search methods: We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, PubMed (subsets not available on Ovid), LILACS as well as the trial registers ICTRP (WHO) and ClinicalTrials.gov. Searches were undertaken from inception to March 2016. We checked references and applied no language restrictions.Selection criteria: We selected randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of pharmacological interventions for treating obesity (licensed and unlicensed for this indication) in children and adolescents (mean age under 18 years) with or without support of family members, with a minimum of three months' pharmacological intervention and six months' follow-up from baseline. We excluded interventions that specifically dealt with the treatment of eating disorders or type 2 diabetes, or included participants with a secondary or syndromic cause of obesity. In addition, we excluded trials which included growth hormone therapies and pregnant participants.Data collection and analysis: Two review authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data following standard Cochrane methodology. Where necessary we contacted authors for additional information.Main results: We included 21 trials and identified eight ongoing trials. The included trials evaluated metformin (11 trials), sibutramine (six trials), orlistat (four trials), and one trial arm investigated the combination of metformin and fluoxetine. The ongoing trials evaluated metformin (four trials), topiramate (two trials) and exenatide (two trials). A total of 2484 people participated in the included trials, 1478 participants were randomised to drug intervention and 904 to comparator groups (91 participants took part in two cross-over trials; 11 participants not specified). Eighteen trials used a placebo in the comparator group. Two trials had a cross-over design while the remaining 19 trials were parallel RCTs. The length of the intervention period ranged from 12 weeks to 48 weeks, and the length of follow-up from baseline ranged from six months to 100 weeks.Trials generally had a low risk of bias for random sequence generation, allocation concealment and blinding (participants, personnel and assessors) for subjective and objective outcomes. We judged approximately half of the trials as having a high risk of bias in one or more domain such as selective reporting.The primary outcomes of this review were change in body mass index (BMI), change in weight and adverse events. All 21 trials measured these outcomes. The secondary outcomes were health-related quality of life (only one trial reported results showing no marked differences; very low certainty evidence), body fat distribution (measured in 18 trials), behaviour change (measured in six trials), participants' views of the intervention (not reported), morbidity associated with the intervention (measured in one orlistat trial only reporting more new gallstones following the intervention; very low certainty evidence), all-cause mortality (one suicide in the orlistat intervention group; low certainty evidence) and socioeconomic effects (not reported).Intervention versus comparator for mean difference (MD) in BMI change was -1.3 kg/m2 (95% confidence interval (CI) -1.9 to -0.8; P < 0.00001; 16 trials; 1884 participants; low certainty evidence). When split by drug type, sibutramine, metformin and orlistat all showed reductions in BMI in favour of the intervention.Intervention versus comparator for change in weight showed a MD of -3.9 kg (95% CI -5.9 to -1.9; P < 0.00001; 11 trials; 1180 participants; low certainty evidence). As with BMI, when the trials were split by drug type, sibutramine, metformin and orlistat all showed reductions in weight in favour of the intervention.Five trials reported serious adverse events: 24/878 (2.7%) participants in the intervention groups versus 8/469 (1.7%) participants in the comparator groups (risk ratio (RR) 1.43, 95% CI 0.63 to 3.25; 1347 participants; low certainty evidence). A total 52/1043 (5.0%) participants in the intervention groups versus 17/621 (2.7%) in the comparator groups discontinued the trial because of adverse events (RR 1.45, 95% CI 0.83 to 2.52; 10 trials; 1664 participants; low certainty evidence). The most common adverse events in orlistat and metformin trials were gastrointestinal (such as diarrhoea, mild abdominal pain or discomfort, fatty stools). The most frequent adverse events in sibutramine trials included tachycardia, constipation and hypertension. The single fluoxetine trial reported dry mouth and loose stools. No trial investigated drug treatment for overweight children.Authors' conclusions: This systematic review is part of a series of associated Cochrane reviews on interventions for obese children and adolescents and has shown that pharmacological interventions (metformin, sibutramine, orlistat and fluoxetine) may have small effects in reduction in BMI and bodyweight in obese children and adolescents. However, many of these drugs are not licensed for the treatment of obesity in children and adolescents, or have been withdrawn. Trials were generally of low quality with many having a short or no post-intervention follow-up period and high dropout rates (overall dropout of 25%). Future research should focus on conducting trials with sufficient power and long-term follow-up, to ensure the long-term effects of any pharmacological intervention are comprehensively assessed. Adverse events should be reported in a more standardised manner specifying amongst other things the number of participants experiencing at least one adverse event. The requirement of regulatory authorities (US Food and Drug Administration and European Medicines Agency) for trials of all new medications to be used in children and adolescents should drive an increase in the number of high quality trials.US: http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD012436/abstractRecord #143 of 271ID: CD011163AU: Uthman Olalekan AAU: Hartley LouiseAU: Rees KarenAU: Taylor FionaAU: Ebrahim ShahAU: Clarke AileenTI: Multiple risk factor interventions for primary prevention of cardiovascular disease in low- and middle-income countriesSO: Cochrane Database of Systematic ReviewsYR: 2015NO: 8PB: John Wiley & Sons, LtdKY: Developing Countries;Cardiovascular Diseases [prevention & control];Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2 [therapy];Diet;Exercise;Health Promotion [methods];Hypertension [therapy];Primary Prevention [methods];Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic;Risk Factors;Humans[checkword]CC: VASCDOI: 10.1002/14651858.CD011163.pub2AB: Background: In many low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) morbidity and mortality associated with cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) have grown exponentially over recent years. It is estimated that about 80% of CVD deaths occur in LMICs. People in LMICs are more exposed to cardiovascular risk factors such as tobacco, and often do not have access to effective and equitable healthcare services (including early detection services). Evidence from high-income countries indicates that multiple risk factor intervention programmes do not result in reductions in CVD events. Given the increasing incidence of CVDs and lower CVD health awareness in LMICs it is possible that such programmes may have beneficial effects.Objectives: To determine the effectiveness of multiple risk factor interventions (with or without pharmacological treatment) aimed at modifying major cardiovascular risk factors for the primary prevention of CVD in LMICs.Search methods: We searched (from inception to 27 June 2014) the Cochrane Library (CENTRAL, HTA, DARE, EED), MEDLINE, EMBASE, Global Health and three other databases on 27 June 2014. We also searched two clinical trial registers and conducted reference checking to identify additional studies. We applied no language limits.Selection criteria: We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of health promotion interventions to achieve behaviour change (i.e. smoking cessation, dietary advice, increasing activity levels) with or without pharmacological treatments, which aim to alter more than one cardiovascular risk factor (i.e. diet, reduce blood pressure, smoking, total blood cholesterol or increase physical activity) of at least six months duration of follow-up conducted in LMICs.Data collection and analysis: Two authors independently assessed trial eligibility and risk of bias, and extracted data. We combined dichotomous data using risk ratios (RRs) and continuous data using mean differences (MDs), and presented all results with a 95% confidence interval (CI). The primary outcome was combined fatal and non-fatal cardiovascular disease events.Main results: Thirteen trials met the inclusion criteria and are included in the review. All studies had at least one domain with unclear risk of bias. Some studies were at high risk of bias for random sequence generation (two trials), allocation concealment (two trials), blinding of outcome assessors (one trial) and incomplete outcome data (one trial). Duration and content of multiple risk factor interventions varied across the trials. Two trials recruited healthy participants and the other 11 trials recruited people with varying risks of CVD, such as participants with known hypertension and type 2 diabetes. Only one study reported CVD outcomes and multiple risk factor interventions did not reduce the incidence of cardiovascular events (RR 0.57, 95% CI 0.11 to 3.07, 232 participants, low-quality evidence); the result is imprecise (a wide confidence interval and small sample size) and makes it difficult to draw a reliable conclusion. None of the included trials reported all-cause mortality. The pooled effect indicated a reduction in systolic blood pressure (MD -6.72 mmHg, 95% CI -9.82 to -3.61, I² = 91%, 4868 participants, low-quality evidence), diastolic blood pressure (MD -4.40 mmHg, 95% CI -6.47 to -2.34, I² = 92%, 4701 participants, low-quality evidence), body mass index (MD -0.76 kg/m², 95% CI -1.29 to -0.22, I² = 80%, 2984 participants, low-quality evidence) and waist circumference (MD -3.31, 95% CI -4.77 to -1.86, I² = 55%, 393 participants, moderate-quality evidence) in favour of multiple risk factor interventions, but there was substantial heterogeneity. There was insufficient evidence to determine the effect of these interventions on consumption of fruit or vegetables, smoking cessation, glycated haemoglobin, fasting blood sugar, high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol and total cholesterol. None of the included trials reported on adverse events.Authors' conclusions: Due to the limited evidence currently available, we can draw no conclusions as to the effectiveness of multiple risk factor interventions on combined CVD events and mortality. There is some evidence that multiple risk factor interventions may lower blood pressure levels, body mass index and waist circumference in populations in LMIC settings at high risk of hypertension and diabetes. There was considerable heterogeneity between the trials, the trials were small, and at some risk of bias. Larger studies with longer follow-up periods are required to confirm whether multiple risk factor interventions lead to reduced CVD events and mortality in LMIC settings.US: http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD011163.pub2/abstractRecord #144 of 271ID: CD007605AU: Langer GeroAU: Großmann KatjaAU: Fleischer SteffenAU: Berg AlmuthAU: Grothues DirkAU: Wienke AndreasAU: Behrens JohannAU: Fink AstridTI: Nutritional interventions for liver-transplanted patientsSO: Cochrane Database of Systematic ReviewsYR: 2012NO: 8PB: John Wiley & Sons, LtdKY: Dietary Supplements;Enteral Nutrition;Liver Transplantation;Parenteral Nutrition;Malnutrition [therapy];Postoperative Care [methods];Preoperative Care [methods];Humans[checkword]CC: LIVERDOI: 10.1002/14651858.CD007605.pub2AB: Background: Malnutrition is a common problem for patients waiting for orthotopic liver transplantation and a risk factor for post-transplant morbidity. The decision to initiate enteral or parenteral nutrition, to which patients and at which time, is still debated. The effects of nutritional supplements given before or after liver transplantation, or both, still remains unclear.Objectives: The aim of this review was to assess the beneficial and harmful effects of enteral and parenteral nutrition as well as oral nutritional supplements administered to patients before and after liver transplantation.Search methods: We searched the Cochrane Hepato-Biliary Group Controlled Trials Register (March 2012), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (Issue 2 of 12, 2012) in The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE (January 1946 to March 2012), EMBASE (January 1974 to March 2012), Science Citation Index Expanded (January 1900 to March 2012), Social Science Citation Index (January 1961 to October 2010), and reference lists of articles. Manufacturers and experts in the field have also been contacted and relevant journals and conference proceedings were handsearched (from 1997 to October 2010).Selection criteria: Randomised clinical trials of parallel or cross-over design evaluating the beneficial or harmful effects of enteral or parenteral nutrition or oral nutritional supplements for patients before and after liver transplantation were eligible for inclusion.Data collection and analysis: Two authors independently assessed the risk of bias of the trials and extracted data. Dichotomous data were reported as odds ratios (OR) and continuous data as mean differences (MD) along with their corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CI). Meta-analysis was not possible due to clinical heterogeneity of included interventions.Main results: Thirteen trials met the inclusion criteria. Four publications did not report outcomes pre-defined in the review protocol, or other clinically relevant outcomes and additional data could not be obtained. Nine trials could provide data for the review. Most of the 13 included trials were small and at high risk of bias. Meta-analyses were not possible due to clinical heterogeneity of the interventions.No interventions that were likely to be beneficial were identified.For interventions of unknown effectiveness,postoperative enteral nutrition compared with postoperative parenteral nutrition seemed to have no beneficial or harmful effects on clinical outcomes. Parenteral nutrition containing protein, fat, carbohydrates, and branched-chain amino acids with or without alanyl-glutamine seemed to have no beneficial effect on the outcomes of one and three years survival when compared with a solution of 5% dextrose and normal saline. Enteral immunonutrition with Supportan® seemed to have no effect on occurrence of immunological rejection when compared with enteral nutrition with Fresubin®.There is weak evidence that, compared with standard dietary advice, adding a nutritional supplement to usual diet for patients during the waiting time for liver transplantation had an effect on clinical outcomes after liver transplantation. The combination of enteral nutrition plus parenteral nutrition plus glutamine-dipeptide seemed to be beneficial in reducing length of hospital stay after liver transplantation compared with standard parenteral nutrition (mean difference (MD) -12.20 days; 95% CI -20.20 to -4.00). There is weak evidence that the use of parenteral nutrition plus branched-chain amino acids had an effect on clinical outcomes compared with standard parenteral nutrition, but each was beneficial in reducing length of stay in intensive care unit compared to a standard glucose solution (MD -2.40; 95% CI -4.29 to -0.51 and MD -2.20 days; 95% CI -3.79 to -0.61). There is weak evidence that adding omega-3 fish oil to parenteral nutrition reduced the length of hospital stay after liver transplantation (mean difference -7.1 days; 95% CI -13.02 to -1.18) and the length of stay in intensive care unit after liver transplantation (MD -1.9 days; 95% CI -1.9 to -0.22).For interventions unlikely to be beneficial, there is a significant increased risk in acute rejections in malnourished patients with a history of encephalopathy and treated with the nutritional supplement Ensure® compared with usual diet only (MD 0.70 events per patient; 95% CI 0.08 to 1.32).Authors' conclusions: We were unable to identify nutritional interventions for liver transplanted patients that seemed to offer convincing benefits. Further randomised clinical trials with low risk of bias and powerful sample sizes are needed.US: http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD007605.pub2/abstractRecord #145 of 271ID: CD006772AU: Buckley Brian SAU: Byrne Mary CAU: Smith Susan MTI: Service organisation for the secondary prevention of ischaemic heart disease in primary careSO: Cochrane Database of Systematic ReviewsYR: 2010NO: 3PB: John Wiley & Sons, LtdKY: Myocardial Ischemia [prevention & control];Patient Compliance;Primary Health Care [organization & administration];Secondary Prevention [organization & administration];Humans[checkword]CC: VASCDOI: 10.1002/14651858.CD006772.pub2AB: Background: Ischaemic heart disease (IHD) is a major cause of mortality and morbidity and its prevalence is set to increase. Secondary prevention aims to prevent subsequent acute events in people with established IHD. While the benefits of individual medical and lifestyle interventions is established, the effectiveness of interventions which seek to improve the way secondary preventive care is delivered in primary care or community settings is less so.Objectives: To assess the effectiveness of service organisation interventions, identifying which types and elements of service change are associated with most improvement in clinician and patient adherence to secondary prevention recommendations relating to risk factor levels and monitoring (blood pressure, cholesterol and lifestyle factors such as diet, exercise, smoking and obesity) and appropriate prophylactic medication.Search methods: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, The Cochrane Library 2007, Issue 4), MEDLINE (1966 to Feb 2008), EMBASE (1980 to Feb 2008), and CINAHL (1981 to Feb 2008). Bibliographies were checked. No language restrictions were applied.Selection criteria: Randomised or quasi-randomised controlled trials of service organisation interventions in primary care or community settings in populations with established IHD.Data collection and analysis: Analyses were conducted according to Cochrane recommendations and Odds Ratios (with 95% confidence intervals) reported for dichotomous outcomes, mean differences (with 95% CIs) for continuous outcomes.Main results: Eleven studies involving 12,074 people with IHD were included. Increased proportions of patients with total cholesterol levels within recommended levels at 12 months, OR 1.90 (1.04 to 3.48), were associated with interventions that included regular planned appointments, patient education and structured monitoring of medication and risk factors, but significant heterogeneity was apparent. Results relating to blood pressure within target levels bordered on statistical significance. There were no significant effects of interventions on mean blood pressure or cholesterol levels, prescribing, smoking status or body mass index. Few data were available on the effect on diet. There was some suggestion of a "ceiling effect" whereby interventions have a diminishing beneficial effect once certain levels of risk factor management are reached.Authors' conclusions: There is weak evidence that regular planned recall of patients for appointments, structured monitoring of risk factors and prescribing, and education for patients can be effective in increasing the proportions of patients within target levels for cholesterol control and blood pressure. Further research in this area would benefit from greater standardisation of the outcomes measured.US: http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD006772.pub2/abstractRecord #146 of 271ID: CD009104AU: Miller Brendan JAU: Murray LindaAU: Beckmann Michael MAU: Kent TerrenceAU: Macfarlane BonnieTI: Dietary supplements for preventing postnatal depressionSO: Cochrane Database of Systematic ReviewsYR: 2013NO: 10PB: John Wiley & Sons, LtdKY: Dietary Supplements;Depression, Postpartum [prevention & control];Docosahexaenoic Acids [administration & dosage];Eicosapentaenoic Acid [administration & dosage];Patient Dropouts [statistics & numerical data];Prenatal Care;Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic;Selenium [administration & dosage];Female[checkword];Humans[checkword];Pregnancy[checkword]DOI: 10.1002/14651858.CD009104.pub2AB: Background: Postnatal depression is a medical condition that affects many women and the development of their infants. There is a lack of evidence for treatment and prevention strategies that are safe for mothers and infants. Certain dietary deficiencies in a pregnant or postnatal woman's diet may cause postnatal depression. By correcting these deficiencies postnatal depression could be prevented in some women. Specific examples of dietary supplements aimed at preventing postnatal depression include: omega-3 fatty acids, iron, folate, s-adenosyl-L-methionine, cobalamin, pyridoxine, riboflavin, vitamin D and calcium.Objectives: To assess the benefits of dietary supplements for preventing postnatal depression either in the antenatal period, postnatal period, or both.Search methods: We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (30 April 2013).Selection criteria: Randomised controlled trials, involving women who were pregnant or who had given birth in the previous six weeks, who were not depressed or taking antidepressants at the commencement of the trials. The trials could use as intervention any dietary supplementation alone or in combination with another treatment compared with any other preventive treatment, or placebo, or standard clinical care.Data collection and analysis: Two review authors independently assessed trials for inclusion and assessed the risk of bias for the two included studies. Two review authors extracted data and the data were checked for accuracy.Main results: We included two randomised controlled trials.One trial compared oral 100 microgram (µg) selenium yeast tablets with placebo, taken from the first trimester until birth. The trial randomised 179 women but outcome data were only provided for 85 women. Eighty-three women were randomised to each arm of the trial. Sixty-one women completed the selenium arm, 44 of whom completed an Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS). In the placebo arm, 64 women completed the trial, 41 of whom completed an EPDS. This included study (n = 85) found selenium had an effect on EPDS scores but did not reach statistical significance (P = 0.07). There was a mean difference (MD) of -1.90 (95% confidence interval (CI) -3.92 to 0.12) of the self-reported EPDS completed by participants within eight weeks of delivery. There was a high risk of attrition bias due to a large proportion of women withdrawing from the study or not completing an EPDS. This included study did not report on any of the secondary outcomes of this review.The other trial compared docosahexanoic acid (DHA) and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) with placebo. The trial randomised 126 women at risk of postpartum depression to three arms: 42 were allocated to EPA, 42 to DHA, and 42 to placebo. Three women in the EPA arm, four in the DHA arm, and one woman in the placebo arm were lost to follow-up. Women who were found to have major depressive disorder, bipolar disorder, current substance abuse or dependence, suicidal ideation or schizophrenia at recruitment were excluded from the study. The women who discontinued the intervention (five in the EPA arm, four in the DHA arm and seven in the placebo arm) were included in the intention-to-treat analysis, while those who were lost to follow-up were not. Women received supplements or placebo from recruitment at a gestational age of 12 to 20 weeks until their final review visit six to eight weeks postpartum. The primary outcome measure was the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) score at the fifth visit (six to eight weeks postpartum). No benefit was found for EPA-rich fish oil (MD 0.70, 95% CI -1.78 to 3.18) or DHA-rich fish oil supplementation (MD 0.90, 95% CI -1.33 to 3.13) in preventing postpartum depression. No difference was found in the effect on postnatal depression comparing EPA with DHA (MD -0.20, 95% CI -2.61 to 2.21). No benefit or significant effect was found in terms of the secondary outcomes of the presence of major depressive disorder at six to eight weeks postpartum, the number of women who commenced antidepressants, maternal estimated blood loss at delivery or admission of neonates to the neonatal intensive care unit.Authors' conclusions: There is insufficient evidence to conclude that selenium, DHA or EPA prevent postnatal depression. There is currently no evidence to recommend any other dietary supplement for prevention of postnatal depression.US: http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD009104.pub2/abstractRecord #147 of 271ID: CD003204AU: Wu TaixiangAU: Liu Guan JianAU: Li PingAU: Clar ChristineTI: Iodised salt for preventing iodine deficiency disordersSO: Cochrane Database of Systematic ReviewsYR: 2002NO: 3PB: John Wiley & Sons, LtdKY: Cross-Sectional Studies;Dietary Supplements;Intellectual Disability [prevention & control];Iodine [administration & dosage] [deficiency];Prospective Studies;Sodium Chloride, Dietary [administration & dosage];Humans[checkword]CC: ENDOCDOI: 10.1002/14651858.CD003204AB: Background: Iodine deficiency is the main cause for potentially preventable mental retardation in childhood, as well as causing goitre and hypothyroidism in people of all ages. It is still prevalent in large parts of the world.Objectives: To assess the effects of iodised salt in comparison with other forms of iodine supplementation or placebo in the prevention of iodine deficiency disorders.Search methods: We searched The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, the Register of Chinese trials developed by the Chinese Cochrane Centre, and the Chinese Med Database, China National knowledge Infrastructure, and searched reference lists, databases of ongoing trials and the Internet.Selection criteria: We included prospective controlled studies of iodised salt versus other forms of iodine supplementation or placebo in people living in areas of iodine deficiency. Studies reported mainly goitre rates and urinary iodine excretion as outcome measures.Data collection and analysis: The initial data selection and quality assessment of trials was done independently by two reviewers. Subsequently, after the scope of the review was slightly widened from including only randomised controlled trials to including non-randomised prospective comparative studies, a third reviewer repeated the trials selection and quality assessment. As the studies identified were not sufficiently similar and not of sufficient quality, we did not do a meta-analysis but summarised the data in a narrative format.Main results: We found six prospective controlled trials relating to our question. Four of these were described as randomised controlled trials, one was a prospective controlled trial that did not specify allocation to comparison groups, and one was a repeated cross-sectional study comparing different interventions. Comparison interventions included non-iodised salt, iodised water, iodised oil, and salt iodisation with potassium iodide versus potassium iodate. Numbers of participants in the trials ranged from 35 to 334; over 20,000 people were included in the cross-sectional study. Three studies were in children only, two investigated both groups of children and adults and one investigated pregnant women. There was a tendency towards goitre reduction with iodised salt, although this was not significant in all studies. There was also an improved iodine status in most studies (except in small children in one of the studies), although urinary iodine excretion did not always reach the levels recommended by the WHO. None of the studies observed any adverse effects of iodised salt.Authors' conclusions: The results suggest that iodised salt is an effective means of improving iodine status. No conclusions can be made about improvements in other, more patient-oriented outcomes, such as physical and mental development in children and mortality. None of the studies specifically investigated development of iodine-induced hyperthyroidism, which can be easily overlooked if just assessed on the basis of symptoms. High quality controlled studies investigating relevant long term outcome measures are needed to address questions of dosage and best means of iodine supplementation in different population groups and settings.US: http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD003204/abstractRecord #148 of 271ID: CD007065AU: Neilson James PTI: Interventions for heartburn in pregnancySO: Cochrane Database of Systematic ReviewsYR: 2008NO: 4PB: John Wiley & Sons, LtdKY: Heartburn [therapy];Pregnancy Complications [therapy];Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic;Female[checkword];Humans[checkword];Pregnancy[checkword]CC: PREGDOI: 10.1002/14651858.CD007065.pub2AB: Background: Heartburn is a common symptom in pregnancy affecting up to 80% of women in the third trimester. The reasons for the increase in symptoms in pregnancy are not well understood, but the effects of pregnancy hormones on the lower oesophageal sphincter and gastric clearance are thought to play a part. A range of interventions have been used to relieve symptoms including advice on diet and lifestyle, antacids, antihistamines, and proton pump inhibitors. The safety and effectiveness of these interventions to relieve heartburn in pregnancy have not been established.Objectives: To assess the effect of interventions to relieve heartburn in pregnancy.Search methods: We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (April 2008). We updated this search on 10 November 2012 and added the results to the awaiting classification section of the review.Selection criteria: We included randomised controlled trials evaluating interventions to relieve heartburn.Data collection and analysis: We assessed eligibility for inclusion and extracted data independently.Main results: Three studies were eligible for inclusion, together they included a total of 286 women. All three were placebo controlled trials, each examining a different medication to relieve heartburn (intramuscular prostigmine, an antacid preparation and an antacid plus ranitidine). All three produced positive findings in favour of the intervention groups. It was not possible to pool findings from studies to produce an overall treatment effect.Authors' conclusions: There was little information to draw conclusions on the overall effectiveness of interventions to relieve heartburn in pregnancy.[Note: the two citations in the awaiting classification section of the review may alter the conclusions of the review once assessed.]US: http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD007065.pub2/abstractRecord #149 of 271ID: CD011834AU: Hooper LeeAU: Abdelhamid AsmaaAU: Bunn DianeAU: Brown TraceyAU: Summerbell Carolyn DAU: Skeaff C MurrayTI: Effects of total fat intake on body weightSO: Cochrane Database of Systematic ReviewsYR: 2015NO: 8PB: John Wiley & Sons, LtdKY: Energy Intake;Portion Size;Waist Circumference;Weight Loss;Age Factors;Body Mass Index;Body Weight;Dietary Fats [administration & dosage];Obesity [diet therapy];Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic;Adolescent[checkword];Adult[checkword];Child[checkword];Female[checkword];Humans[checkword];Male[checkword];Middle Aged[checkword];Young Adult[checkword]DOI: 10.1002/14651858.CD011834AB: Background: In order to prevent overweight and obesity in the general population we need to understand the relationship between the proportion of energy from fat and resulting weight and body fatness in the general population.Objectives: To assess the effects of proportion of energy intake from fat on measures of weight and body fatness (including obesity, waist circumference and body mass index) in people not aiming to lose weight, using all appropriate randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and cohort studies in adults, children and young peopleSearch methods: We searched CENTRAL to March 2014 and MEDLINE, EMBASE and CINAHL to November 2014. We did not limit the search by language. We also checked the references of relevant reviews.Selection criteria: Trials fulfilled the following criteria: 1) randomised intervention trial, 2) included children (aged ≥ 24 months), young people or adults, 3) randomised to a lower fat versus usual or moderate fat diet, without the intention to reduce weight in any participants, 4) not multifactorial and 5) assessed a measure of weight or body fatness after at least six months. We also included cohort studies in children, young people and adults that assessed the proportion of energy from fat at baseline and assessed the relationship with body weight or fatness after at least one year. We duplicated inclusion decisions and resolved disagreement by discussion or referral to a third party.Data collection and analysis: We extracted data on the population, intervention, control and outcome measures in duplicate. We extracted measures of weight and body fatness independently in duplicate at all available time points. We performed random-effects meta-analyses, meta-regression, subgrouping, sensitivity and funnel plot analyses.Main results: We included 32 RCTs (approximately 54,000 participants) and data from 25 cohorts. There is consistent evidence from RCTs in adults of a small weight-reducing effect of eating a smaller proportion of energy from fat; this was seen in almost all included studies and was highly resistant to sensitivity analyses. The effect of eating less fat (compared with usual diet) is a mean weight reduction of 1.5 kg (95% confidence interval (CI) -2.0 to -1.1 kg), but greater weight loss results from greater fat reductions. The size of the effect on weight does not alter over time and is mirrored by reductions in body mass index (BMI) (-0.5 kg/m2, 95% CI -0.7 to -0.3) and waist circumference (-0.3 cm, 95% CI -0.6 to -0.02). Included cohort studies in children and adults most often do not suggest any relationship between total fat intake and later measures of weight, body fatness or change in body fatness. However, there was a suggestion that lower fat intake was associated with smaller increases in weight in middle-aged but not elderly adults, and in change in BMI in the highest validity child cohort.Authors' conclusions: Trials where participants were randomised to a lower fat intake versus usual or moderate fat intake, but with no intention to reduce weight, showed a consistent, stable but small effect of low fat intake on body fatness: slightly lower weight, BMI and waist circumference compared with controls. Greater fat reduction and lower baseline fat intake were both associated with greater reductions in weight. This effect of reducing total fat was not consistently reflected in cohort studies assessing the relationship between total fat intake and later measures of body fatness or change in body fatness in studies of children, young people or adults.US: http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD011834/abstractRecord #150 of 271ID: CD009002AU: Burckhardt MarionAU: Herke MaxAU: Wustmann TobiasAU: Watzke StefanAU: Langer GeroAU: Fink AstridTI: Omega-3 fatty acids for the treatment of dementiaSO: Cochrane Database of Systematic ReviewsYR: 2016NO: 4PB: John Wiley & Sons, LtdKY: Alzheimer Disease [drug therapy];Cognition [drug effects];Fatty Acids, Omega-3 [therapeutic use];Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic;Humans[checkword]DOI: 10.1002/14651858.CD009002.pub3AB: Background: Omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (omega-3 PUFAs) from fish and plant sources are commonly considered as a promising non-medical alternative to improve brain functions and slow down the progression of dementia. This assumption is mostly based on findings of preclinical studies and epidemiological research. Resulting explanatory models aim at the role omega-3 PUFAs play in the development and integrity of the brain's neurons, their protective antioxidative effect on cell membranes and potential neurochemical mechanisms directly related to Alzheimer-specific pathology. Epidemiological research also found evidence of malnutrition in people with dementia. Considering this and the fact that omega-3 PUFA cannot be synthesised by humans, omega-3 PUFAs might be a promising treatment option for dementia.Objectives: To assess the efficacy and safety of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) supplementation for the treatment of people with dementia.Search methods: We searched the Specialized Register of the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group (ALOIS), MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, CINAHL, ClinicalTrials.gov and the World Health Organization (WHO) portal/ICTRP on 10 December 2015. We contacted manufacturers of omega-3 supplements and scanned reference lists of landmark papers and included articles.Selection criteria: We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in which omega-3 PUFA in the form of supplements or enriched diets were administered to people with Alzheimer's disease (AD), vascular dementia (VaD), dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), Parkinson's disease dementia (PDD) or frontotemporal dementia (FTD).Data collection and analysis: The primary outcome measures of interest were changes in global and specific cognitive functions, functional performance, dementia severity and adverse effects. Two review authors independently selected studies, extracted data and assessed the quality of trials according to the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions. We rated the quality of the evidence using the GRADE approach. We received unpublished data from the trial authors and collected adverse effects information from the published articles. We conducted meta-analyses for available outcome measures at six months.Main results: We included three comparable randomised, placebo-controlled trials investigating omega-3 PUFA supplements in 632 participants with mild to moderate AD over six, 12 and 18 months. We found no studies investigating other types of dementia. All trials were of high methodological quality. The overall quality of evidence for most of the outcomes was high.There was no evidence of a benefit from omega-3 PUFAs on cognitive function when measured at six months with the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale - Cognitive subscale (standardised mean difference (SMD) -0.02, 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.19 to 0.15; 566 participants; 3 studies; high quality evidence) or Mini-Mental State Examination (mean difference (MD) 0.18, 95% CI -1.05 to 1.41; 202 participants; 2 studies; high quality evidence) or on activities of daily living (SMD -0.02, 95% CI -0.19 to 0.16; 544 participants; 2 studies; high quality evidence). There was also no effect at six months of treatment on severity of dementia measured with the Clinical Dementia Rating - Sum of Boxes (MD -0.00, 95% CI -0.58 to 0.57; 542 participants; 2 studies; high quality evidence) or on quality of life measured with the Quality of Life Alzheimer's Disease scale (MD -0.10, 95% CI -1.28 to 1.08; 322 participants; 1 study; high quality evidence). There was no difference at six months on mental health measured with the Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MD -0.10, 95% CI -0.74 to 0.54; 178 participants: 1 study; high quality of evidence) or the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (SMD 0.10, 95% CI -0.07 to 0.27; 543 participants; 2 studies; high quality of evidence). One very small study showed a benefit for omega-3 PUFAs in instrumental activities of daily living after 12 months of treatment (MD -3.50, 95% CI -4.30 to -2.70; 22 participants; moderate quality evidence). The included studies did not measure specific cognitive function. The studies did not report adverse events well. Two studies stated that all adverse events were mild and that they did not differ in overall frequency between omega-3 PUFA and placebo groups. Data from one study showed no difference between groups in frequency of any adverse event (risk ratio (RR) 1.02, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.10; 402 participants; 1 study; moderate quality evidence) or any serious adverse event (RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.41; 402 participants; 1 study; high quality evidence) at 18 months of treatment.Authors' conclusions: We found no convincing evidence for the efficacy of omega-3 PUFA supplements in the treatment of mild to moderate AD. This result was consistent for all outcomes relevant for people with dementia. Adverse effects of omega-3 PUFAs seemed to be low, but based on the evidence synthesised in this review, we cannot make a final statement on tolerability.

Switching strategies have been recommended as a management option.Objectives: To determine the effects of antipsychotic medication switching as a strategy for reducing or preventing weight gain and metabolic problems in people with schizophrenia.Search methods: We searched key databases and the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group's trials register (January 2005 and June 2007), reference sections within relevant papers and contacted the first author of each relevant study and other experts to collect further information.We updated this search November 2012 and added 167 new trials to the awaiting classification section.Selection criteria: All clinical randomised controlled trials comparing switching of antipsychotic medication as an intervention for antipsychotic induced weight gain and metabolic problems with continuation of medication and/or other weight loss treatments (pharmacological and non pharmacological) in people with schizophrenia or schizophrenia-like illnesses.Data collection and analysis: Studies were reliably selected, quality assessed and data extracted. For dichotomous data we calculated risk ratio (RR) and their 95% confidence intervals (CI) on an intention-to-treat basis, based on a fixed-effect model. The primary outcome measures were weight loss, metabolic syndrome, relapse and general mental state.Main results: We included four studies for the review with a total of 636 participants. All except one study had a duration of 26 weeks or less. There was a mean weight loss of 1.94 kg (2 RCT, n = 287, CI -3.9 to 0.08) when switched to aripiprazole or quetiapine from olanzapine. BMI also decreased when switched to quetiapine (1 RCT, n = 129, MD -0.52 CI -1.26 to 0.22) and aripiprazole (1 RCT, n = 173, RR 0.28 CI 0.13 to 0.57) from olanzapine.Fasting blood glucose showed a significant decrease when switched to aripiprazole or quetiapine from olanzapine. (2 RCT, MD -2.53 n = 280 CI -2.94 to -2.11). One RCT also showed a favourable lipid profile when switched to aripiprazole but these measures were reported as percentage changes, rather than means with standard deviation.People are less likely to leave the study early if they remain on olanzapine compared to switching to quetiapine or aripiprazole.There was no significant difference in outcomes of mental state, global state, and adverse events between groups which switched medications and those that remained on previous medication. Three different switching strategies were compared and no strategy was found to be superior to the others for outcomes of weight gain, mental state and global state.Authors' conclusions: Evidence from this review suggests that switching antipsychotic medication to one with lesser potential for causing weight gain or metabolic problems could be an effective way to manage these side effects, but the data were weak due to the limited number of trials in this area and small sample sizes. Poor reporting of data also hindered using some trials and outcomes. There was no difference in mental state, global state and other treatment related adverse events between switching to another medication and continuing on the previous one. When the three switching strategies were compared none of them had an advantage over the others in their effects on the primary outcomes considered in this review. Better designed trials with adequate power would provide more convincing evidence for using medication switching as an intervention strategy.Note: the 167 citations in the awaiting classification section of the review may alter the conclusions of the review once assessed.US: http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD006629.pub2/abstractRecord #154 of 271ID: CD003804AU: Grimley Evans JohnAU: Areosa Sastre AlmudenaTI: Effect of the treatment of Type II diabetes mellitus on the development of cognitive impairment and dementiaSO: Cochrane Database of Systematic ReviewsYR: 2003NO: 1PB: John Wiley & Sons, LtdKY: Cognition Disorders [drug therapy] [etiology];Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2 [complications] [drug therapy];Hypoglycemic Agents [therapeutic use];Memory Disorders [drug therapy] [etiology];Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic;Humans[checkword]CC: DEMENTIADOI: 10.1002/14651858.CD003804AB: Background: There is increasing interest in preventing cognitive impairment and dementia in later life. Epidemiological evidence shows a relationship between cognitive impairment and Type II diabetes. This association is stronger in patients who have been diagnosed for longer periods of time and in those who are on insulin therapy. There is little information on the short- and long-term influence of type of treatment and level of metabolic control on cognitive function of people with diabetes.Objectives: To assess the effects of different types and intensities of treatments for Type II diabetes on cognitive function.Search methods: The CENTRAL Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, SIGLE LILACS and CINAHL as well as a number of ongoing trials databases were last searched on 4 August 2005 using appropriate strategies.Selection criteria: Randomized controlled trials in which different treatments for Type II diabetes have been compared and in which measures of cognitive function were made at entry and after the treatment.Data collection and analysis: Two reviewers independently assessed trial quality. Five trials were identified for possible inclusion but none of them could be included. In one, cognitive function was assessed before and after intensive or conventional diabetic treatment, but the comparison was not double-blind. The three other studies explored the effect of different treatments on QOL but did not include appropriate evaluation of cognitive function. The fifth did not report baseline data on cognitive function in the trial groups.Main results: No studies were found to be appropriate for inclusion in meta-analysis.Authors' conclusions: There is no convincing evidence relating type or intensity of diabetic treatment to the prevention or management of cognitive impairment in Type II diabetes.

Although there are many kinds of interventions, the optimal one for the palliation of dysphagia remains unclear. This review updates the previous version published in 2009.Objectives: The aim of this review was to systematically analyse and summarise the efficacy of different interventions used in the palliation of dysphagia in primary oesophageal and gastro-oesophageal carcinoma.Search methods: To find new studies for this updated review, in January 2014 we searched, according to the Cochrane Upper Gastrointestinal and Pancreatic Diseases model, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library), MEDLINE, EMBASE and CINAHL; and major conference proceedings (up to January 2014).Selection criteria: Only randomised controlled trials (RCTs) were included in which patients with inoperable or unresectable primary oesophageal cancer underwent palliative treatment. Different interventions like rigid plastic intubation, self-expanding metallic stent (SEMS) insertion, brachytherapy, external beam radiotherapy, chemotherapy, oesophageal bypass surgery, chemical and thermal ablation therapy, either head-to-head or in combination, were included. The primary outcome was dysphagia improvement. Secondary outcomes included recurrent dysphagia, technical success, procedure related mortality, 30-day mortality, adverse effects and quality of life.Data collection and analysis: Data collection and analysis were performed in accordance with the methods of the Cochrane Upper Gastrointestinal and Pancreatic Diseases Review Group.Main results: We included 3684 patients from 53 studies. SEMS insertion was safer and more effective than plastic tube insertion. Thermal and chemical ablative therapy provided comparable dysphagia palliation but had an increased requirement for re-interventions and for adverse effects. Anti-reflux stents provided comparable dysphagia palliation to conventional metal stents. Some anti-reflux stents might have reduced gastro-oesophageal reflux and complications. Newly-designed double-layered nitinol (Niti-S) stents were preferable due to longer survival time and fewer complications compared to simple Niti-S stents. Brachytherapy might be a suitable alternative to SEMS in providing a survival advantage and possibly a better quality of life, and might provide better results when combined with argon plasma coagulation or external beam radiation therapy.Authors' conclusions: Self-expanding metal stent insertion is safe, effective and quicker in palliating dysphagia compared to other modalities. However, high-dose intraluminal brachytherapy is a suitable alternative and might provide additional survival benefit with a better quality of life. Some anti-reflux stents and newly-designed stents lead to longer survival and fewer complications compared to conventional stents. Combinations of brachytherapy with self-expanding metal stent insertion or radiotherapy are preferable due to the reduced requirement for re-interventions. Rigid plastic tube insertion, dilatation alone or in combination with other modalities, and chemotherapy alone are not recommended for palliation of dysphagia due to a high incidence of delayed complications and recurrent dysphagia.US: http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD005048.pub4/abstractRecord #156 of 271ID: CD003641AU: Colquitt Jill LAU: Pickett KarenAU: Loveman EmmaAU: Frampton Geoff KTI: Surgery for weight loss in adultsSO: Cochrane Database of Systematic ReviewsYR: 2014NO: 8PB: John Wiley & Sons, LtdKY: Gastric Bypass [methods];Gastroplasty [methods];Ligation [methods];Obesity, Morbid [surgery];Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic;Weight Loss;Adult[checkword];Female[checkword];Humans[checkword];Male[checkword]CC: ENDOCDOI: 10.1002/14651858.CD003641.pub4AB: Background: Bariatric (weight loss) surgery for obesity is considered when other treatments have failed. The effects of the available bariatric procedures compared with medical management and with each other are uncertain. This is an update of a Cochrane review first published in 2003 and most recently updated in 2009.Objectives: To assess the effects of bariatric surgery for overweight and obesity, including the control of comorbidities.Search methods: Studies were obtained from searches of numerous databases, supplemented with searches of reference lists and consultation with experts in obesity research. Date of last search was November 2013.Selection criteria: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing surgical interventions with non-surgical management of obesity or overweight or comparing different surgical procedures.Data collection and analysis: Data were extracted by one review author and checked by a second review author. Two review authors independently assessed risk of bias and evaluated overall study quality utilising the GRADE instrument.Main results: Twenty-two trials with 1798 participants were included; sample sizes ranged from 15 to 250. Most studies followed participants for 12, 24 or 36 months; the longest follow-up was 10 years. The risk of bias across all domains of most trials was uncertain; just one was judged to have adequate allocation concealment.All seven RCTs comparing surgery with non-surgical interventions found benefits of surgery on measures of weight change at one to two years follow-up. Improvements for some aspects of health-related quality of life (QoL) (two RCTs) and diabetes (five RCTs) were also found. The overall quality of the evidence was moderate. Five studies reported data on mortality, no deaths occurred. Serious adverse events (SAEs) were reported in four studies and ranged from 0% to 37% in the surgery groups and 0% to 25% in the no surgery groups. Between 2% and 13% of participants required reoperations in the five studies that reported these data.Three RCTs found that laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (L)(RYGB) achieved significantly greater weight loss and body mass index (BMI) reduction up to five years after surgery compared with laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding (LAGB). Mean end-of-study BMI was lower following LRYGB compared with LAGB: mean difference (MD) -5.2 kg/m² (95% confidence interval (CI) -6.4 to -4.0; P < 0.00001; 265 participants; 3 trials; moderate quality evidence). Evidence for QoL and comorbidities was very low quality. The LRGYB procedure resulted in greater duration of hospitalisation in two RCTs (4/3.1 versus 2/1.5 days) and a greater number of late major complications (26.1% versus 11.6%) in one RCT. In one RCT the LAGB required high rates of reoperation for band removal (9 patients, 40.9%).Open RYGB, LRYGB and laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) led to losses of weight and/or BMI but there was no consistent picture as to which procedure was better or worse in the seven included trials. MD was -0.2 kg/m² (95% CI -1.8 to 1.3); 353 participants; 6 trials; low quality evidence) in favour of LRYGB.  No statistically significant differences in QoL were found (one RCT). Six RCTs reported mortality; one death occurred following LRYGB. SAEs were reported by one RCT and were higher in the LRYGB group (4.5%) than the LSG group (0.9%). Reoperations ranged from 6.7% to 24% in the LRYGB group and 3.3% to 34% in the LSG group. Effects on comorbidities, complications and additional surgical procedures were neutral, except gastro-oesophageal reflux disease improved following LRYGB (one RCT). One RCT of people with a BMI 25 to 35 and type 2 diabetes found laparoscopic mini-gastric bypass resulted in greater weight loss and improvement of diabetes compared with LSG, and had similar levels of complications.Two RCTs found that biliopancreatic diversion with duodenal switch (BDDS) resulted in greater weight loss than RYGB in morbidly obese patients. End-of-study mean BMI loss was greater following BDDS: MD -7.3 kg/m² (95% CI -9.3 to -5.4); P < 0.00001; 107 participants; 2 trials; moderate quality evidence). QoL was similar on most domains. In one study between 82% to 100% of participants with diabetes had a HbA1c of less than 5% three years after surgery. Reoperations were higher in the BDDS group (16.1% to 27.6%) than the LRYGB group (4.3% to 8.3%). One death occurred in the BDDS group.One RCT comparing laparoscopic duodenojejunal bypass with sleeve gastrectomy versus LRYGB found BMI, excess weight loss, and rates of remission of diabetes and hypertension were similar at 12 months follow-up (very low quality evidence). QoL, SAEs and reoperation rates were not reported. No deaths occurred in either group.One RCT comparing laparoscopic isolated sleeve gastrectomy (LISG) versus LAGB found greater improvement in weight-loss outcomes following LISG at three years follow-up (very low quality evidence). QoL, mortality and SAEs were not reported. Reoperations occurred in 20% of the LAGB group and in 10% of the LISG group.One RCT (unpublished) comparing laparoscopic gastric imbrication with LSG found no statistically significant difference in weight loss between groups (very low quality evidence).  QoL and comorbidities were not reported. No deaths occurred. Two participants in the gastric imbrication group required reoperation.Authors' conclusions: Surgery results in greater improvement in weight loss outcomes and weight associated comorbidities compared with non-surgical interventions, regardless of the type of procedures used. When compared with each other, certain procedures resulted in greater weight loss and improvements in comorbidities than others. Outcomes were similar between RYGB and sleeve gastrectomy, and both of these procedures had better outcomes than adjustable gastric banding. For people with very high BMI, biliopancreatic diversion with duodenal switch resulted in greater weight loss than RYGB. Duodenojejunal bypass with sleeve gastrectomy and laparoscopic RYGB had similar outcomes, however this is based on one small trial. Isolated sleeve gastrectomy led to better weight-loss outcomes than adjustable gastric banding after three years follow-up. This was based on one trial only. Weight-related outcomes were similar between laparoscopic gastric imbrication and laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy in one trial. Across all studies adverse event rates and reoperation rates were generally poorly reported. Most trials followed participants for only one or two years, therefore the long-term effects of surgery remain unclear.US: http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD003641.pub4/abstractRecord #157 of 271ID: CD004079AU: Asano Tracey K.AU: McLeod Robin STI: Non steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID) and aspirin for preventing colorectal adenomas and carcinomasSO: Cochrane Database of Systematic ReviewsYR: 2004NO: 1PB: John Wiley & Sons, LtdKY: Adenoma [drug therapy] [prevention & control];Adenomatous Polyposis Coli [drug therapy] [prevention & control];Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal [therapeutic use];Aspirin [therapeutic use];Carcinoma [drug therapy] [prevention & control];Colorectal Neoplasms [drug therapy] [prevention & control];Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic;Remission Induction;Humans[checkword]CC: COLOCADOI: 10.1002/14651858.CD004079.pub2AB: Background: There is evidence from experimental animals studies, prospective and retrospective observational studies that nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS) may reduce the development of sporadic colorectal adenomas (CRAs) and cancer (CRC) and may induce the regression of adenomas in familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP).Objectives: To conduct a systematic review to determine the effect of NSAIDS for the prevention or regression of CRAs and CRC.Search methods: Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) up to September 2003 were identified.Selection criteria: NSAIDS and aspirin (ASA) were the interventions. The primary outcomes were the number of subjects with at least one CRA, the change in polyp burden, and CRC. The secondary outcome was adverse events.Data collection and analysis: Two reviewers independently extracted data and assessed trial quality. Dichotomous outcomes were reported as relative risks (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). The data were combined with the random effects model if clinically and statistically reasonable.Main results: Nine trials with 150 familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) and 24,143 population subjects met the inclusion criteria. The interventions included sulindac, celecoxib, or aspirin (ASA). From the combined results of three trials, significantly fewer subjects in the low dose ASA group developed recurrent sporadic CRAs [RR 0.77 (95% CI 0.61, 0.96), (NNT 12.5 (95% CI 7.7, 25)] after one to three years. In another three trials, phenotypic FAP subjects that received sulindac or celecoxib had a greater proportional reduction (range: 11.9% to 44%) in the number of CRAs compared to those in the control group (range: 4.5% to 10%). There was no significant difference for the outcomes of CRC or adverse events in any of the trials.Authors' conclusions: There was evidence from three pooled RCTs that ASA significantly reduces the recurrence of sporadic adenomatous polyps after one to three years. There is evidence from short-term studies to support regression, but not elimination or prevention of CRAs in FAP.US: http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD004079.pub2/abstractRecord #158 of 271ID: CD010483AU: Brigo FrancescoAU: Igwe Stanley CTI: Antiepileptic drugs for the treatment of infants with severe myoclonic epilepsySO: Cochrane Database of Systematic ReviewsYR: 2015NO: 10PB: John Wiley & Sons, LtdKY: Anticonvulsants [adverse effects] [therapeutic use];Dioxolanes [adverse effects] [therapeutic use];Epilepsies, Myoclonic [drug therapy];Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic;Seizures [drug therapy];Adolescent[checkword];Child[checkword];Child, Preschool[checkword];Female[checkword];Humans[checkword];Male[checkword]CC: EPILEPSYDOI: 10.1002/14651858.CD010483.pub3AB: Background: This is an updated version of the original Cochrane review published in Issue 11, 2013.Severe myoclonic epilepsy in infants (SMEI), also known as Dravet syndrome, is a rare, refractory form of epilepsy, for which stiripentol (STP) has been recently licensed as add-on therapy.Objectives: To evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of STP and other antiepileptic drug treatments (including ketogenic diet) for patients with SMEI.Search methods: We searched the Cochrane Epilepsy Group Specialised Register (27 April 2015), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 27 April 2015) and MEDLINE (1946 to 27 April 2015). We systematically searched the online trials registry ClinicalTrials.gov and the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform and the bibliographies of identified studies for additional references. We handsearched selected journals and conference proceedings and imposed no language restrictions.Selection criteria: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) or quasi-randomised controlled trials; double- or single-blinded or unblinded trials; and parallel-group studies. Administration of at least one antiepileptic drug therapy given singly (monotherapy) or in combination (add-on therapy) compared with add-on placebo or no add-on treatment.Data collection and analysis: Review authors independently selected trials for inclusion according to predefined criteria, extracted relevant data and evaluated the methodological quality of trials. We assessed the following outcomes: 50% or greater seizure reduction, seizure freedom, adverse effects, proportion of dropouts and quality of life. We assessed outcomes by using a Mantel-Haenszel meta-analysis to calculate risk ratios (RRs) with 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs).Main results: In the updated search, we identified no additional studies suitable for inclusion. We found no RCTs assessing drugs other than STP. The previous version of this review included two RCTs evaluating use of STP (total of 64 children). Both studies were generally at unclear risk of bias. A significantly higher proportion of participants had 50% or greater reduction in seizure frequency in the STP group compared with the placebo group (22/33 vs 2/31; RR 10.40, 95% CI 2.64 to 40.87). A significantly higher proportion of participants achieved seizure freedom in the STP group compared with the placebo group (12/33 vs 1/31; RR 7.93, 95% CI 1.52 to 41.21). Investigators found no significant differences in proportions of dropouts from the STP group compared with the placebo group (2/33 vs 8/31; RR 0.24, 95% CI 0.06 to 1.03). Only one study explicitly reported the occurrence of side effects, noting that higher proportions of participants in the STP group experienced side effects than in the placebo group (100% vs 25%; RR 3.73, 95% CI 1.81 to 7.67).Authors' conclusions: Data derived from two small RCTs indicate that STP is significantly better than placebo with regards to 50% or greater reduction in seizure frequency and seizure freedom. Adverse effects occurred more frequently with STP. Additional adequately powered studies with long-term follow-up should be conducted to unequivocally establish the long-term efficacy and tolerability of STP in the treatment of patients with SMEI.US: http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD010483.pub3/abstractRecord #159 of 271ID: CD012333AU: Pfinder ManuelaAU: Katikireddi Srinivasa VAU: Pega FrankAU: Gartlehner GeraldAU: Fenton CandidaAU: Griebler UrsulaAU: Sommer IsoldeAU: Heise Thomas LAU: Lhachimi Stefan KTI: Taxation of unprocessed sugar or sugar-added foods for reducing their consumption and preventing obesity or other adverse health outcomesSO: Cochrane Database of Systematic ReviewsYR: 2016NO: 8PB: John Wiley & Sons, LtdCC: PUBHLTHDOI: 10.1002/14651858.CD012333AB: This is the protocol for a review and there is no abstract.

Psychological interventions are largely concerned with adherence to treatment, emotional and social adaptation and health-related quality of life. We are unaware of any relevant systematic reviews.Objectives: To determine whether psychological interventions for people with cystic fibrosis provide significant psychosocial and physical benefits in addition to standard medical care.Search methods: Studies were identified from two Cochrane trials registers (Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group; Depression, Anxiety and Neurosis Group), Ovid MEDLINE and PsychINFO; unpublished trials were located through professional networks and Listserves.    Most recent search of the Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group's register: 19 December 2013.Most recent search of the Depression, Anxiety and Neurosis Group's register: 12 November 2013.Selection criteria: Randomised controlled studies of a broad range of psychological interventions evaluating subjective and objective health outcomes, such as quality of life or pulmonary function, in individuals of all ages with cystic fibrosis and their immediate family. We were interested in psychological interventions, including psychological methods within the scope of psychotherapeutic or psychosomatic mechanism of action (e.g. cognitive behavioural, cognitive, family systems or systemic, psycho-dynamic, or other, e.g. supportive, relaxation, or biofeedback), which were aimed at improving psychological and psychosocial outcomes (e.g. quality of life, levels of stress or distress, psychopathology, etc.), adaptation to disease management and physiological outcomes.Data collection and analysis: Three authors were involved in selecting the eligible studies and two of these authors assessed their risk of bias.Main results: The review includes 16 studies (eight new studies included in this update) representing data from 556 participants. Studies are diverse in their design and their methods. They cover interventions with generic approaches, as well as interventions developed specifically to target disease-specific symptoms and problems in people with cystic fibrosis. These include cognitive behavioural interventions to improve adherence to nutrition or psychosocial adjustment, cognitive interventions to improve adherence or those associated with decision making in lung transplantation, a community-based support intervention and other interventions, such as self-hypnosis, respiratory muscle biofeedback, music therapy, dance and movement therapy, and a tele-medicine intervention to support patients awaiting transplantation.A substantial proportion of outcomes relate to adherence, changes in physical status or other specific treatment concerns during the chronic phase of the disease.There is some evidence that behavioural interventions targeting nutrition and growth in children (4 to 12 years) with cystic fibrosis are effective in the short term. Evidence was found that providing a structured decision-making tool for patients considering lung transplantation improves patients' knowledge of and expectations about the transplant, and reduces decisional conflict in the short term. One study about training in biofeedback-assisted breathing demonstrated some evidence that it improved some lung function measurements. Currently there is insufficient evidence for interventions aimed at other aspects of the disease process.Authors' conclusions: Currently, insufficient evidence exists on psychological interventions or approaches to support people with cystic fibrosis and their caregivers, although some of the studies were promising. Due to the heterogeneity between studies, more of each type of intervention are needed to support preliminary evidence. Multicentre studies, with consequent funding implications, are needed to increase the sample size of these studies and enhance the statistical power and precision to detect important findings. In addition, multicentre studies could improve the generalisation of results by minimizing centre or therapist effects. Psychological interventions should be targeted to illness-specific symptoms or behaviours to demonstrate efficacy.US: http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD003148.pub3/abstractRecord #161 of 271ID: CD006072AU: Verner Alison MAU: McGuire WilliamAU: Craig John StanleyTI: Effect of taurine supplementation on growth and development in preterm or low birth weight infantsSO: Cochrane Database of Systematic ReviewsYR: 2007NO: 4PB: John Wiley & Sons, LtdKY: Enteral Nutrition;Infant Formula;Infant, Low Birth Weight [growth & development];Infant, Newborn;Infant, Premature [growth & development];Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic;Taurine [administration & dosage];Humans[checkword]CC: NEONATALDOI: 10.1002/14651858.CD006072.pub2AB: Background: Taurine is the most abundant free amino acid in breast milk. Evidence exists that taurine has important roles in intestinal fat absorption, hepatic function, and auditory and visual development in preterm or low birth weight infants. Observational data suggest that relative taurine deficiency during the neonatal period is associated with adverse long-term neurodevelopmental outcomes in preterm infants. Current standard practice is to supplement formula milk and parenteral nutrition solutions with taurine.Objectives: To assess the effect of providing supplemental taurine for enterally or parenterally fed preterm or low birth weight infants on growth and development.Search methods: The standard search strategy of the Cochrane Neonatal Review Group was used. This included searches of the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, The Cochrane Library, Issue 2, 2007), MEDLINE (1966 - June 2007), EMBASE (1980 - June 2007), conference proceedings, and previous reviews.Selection criteria: Randomised or quasi-randomised controlled trials that compared taurine supplementation versus no supplementation in preterm or low birth weight newborn infants.Data collection and analysis: Data were extracted using the standard methods of the Cochrane Neonatal Review Group, with separate evaluation of trial quality and data extraction by two review authors, and synthesis of data using relative risk, risk difference and weighted mean difference.Main results: Nine small trials were identified. In total, 189 infants participated. Most participants were greater than 30 weeks gestational age at birth and were clinically stable. In eight of the studies, taurine was given enterally with formula milk. Only one small trial assessed parenteral taurine supplementation. Taurine supplementation increased intestinal fat absorption [weighted mean difference 4.0 (95% confidence interval 1.4, 6.6) percent of intake]. However, meta-analyses did not reveal any statistically significant effects on growth parameters assessed during the neonatal period or until three to four months chronological age [rate of weight gain: weighted mean difference -0.25 (95% confidence interval -1.16, 0.66) grams/kilogram/day; change in length: weighted mean difference 0.37 (95% confidence interval -0.23, 0.98) millimetres/week; change in head circumference: weighted mean difference 0.15 (95% confidence interval -0.19, 0.50) millimeters/week]. There are very limited data on the effect on neonatal mortality or morbidities, and no data on long-term growth or neurological outcomes.Authors' conclusions: Despite that lack of evidence of benefit from randomised controlled trials, it is likely that taurine will continue to be added to formula milks and parenteral nutrition solutions used for feeding preterm and low birth weight infants given the putative association of taurine deficiency with various adverse outcomes. Further randomised controlled trials of taurine supplementation versus no supplementation in preterm or low birth weight infants are unlikely to be viewed as a research priority, but there may be issues related to dose or duration of supplementation in specific subgroups of infants that merit further research.US: http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD006072.pub2/abstractRecord #162 of 271ID: CD001561AU: Ebrahim ShahAU: Taylor FionaAU: Ward KirstenAU: Beswick AndrewAU: Burke MargaretAU: Davey Smith GeorgeTI: Multiple risk factor interventions for primary prevention of coronary heart diseaseSO: Cochrane Database of Systematic ReviewsYR: 2011NO: 1PB: John Wiley & Sons, LtdKY: Coronary Disease [mortality] [prevention & control];Counseling;Health Promotion;Patient Education as Topic;Primary Prevention;Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic;Risk Factors;Adult[checkword];Humans[checkword]CC: VASCDOI: 10.1002/14651858.CD001561.pub3AB: Background: Multiple risk factor interventions using counselling and educational methods assumed to be efficacious and cost-effective in reducing coronary heart disease (CHD) mortality and morbidity and that they should be expanded. Trials examining risk factor changes have cast doubt on the effectiveness of these interventions.Objectives: To assess the effects of multiple risk factor interventions for reducing total mortality, fatal and non-fatal events from CHD and cardiovascular risk factors among adults assumed to be without prior clinical evidence CHD..Search methods: We updated the original search BY SEARCHING CENTRAL (2006, Issue 2), MEDLINE (2000 to June 2006) and EMBASE (1998 to June 2006), and checking bibliographies.Selection criteria: Randomised controlled trials of more than six months duration using counselling or education to modify more than one cardiovascular risk factor in adults from general populations, occupational groups or specific risk factors (i.e. diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidaemia, obesity).Data collection and analysis: Two authors extracted data independently. We expressed categorical variables as odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Where studies published subsequent follow-up data on mortality and event rates, we updated these data.Main results: We found 55 trials (163,471 participants) with a median duration of 12 month follow up. Fourteen trials (139,256 participants) with reported clinical event endpoints, the pooled ORs for total and CHD mortality were 1.00 (95% CI 0.96 to 1.05) and 0.99 (95% CI 0.92 to 1.07), respectively. Total mortality and combined fatal and non-fatal cardiovascular events showed benefits from intervention when confined to trials involving people with hypertension (16 trials) and diabetes (5 trials): OR 0.78 (95% CI 0.68 to 0.89) and OR 0.71 (95% CI 0.61 to 0.83), respectively. Net changes (weighted mean differences) in systolic and diastolic blood pressure (53 trials) and blood cholesterol (50 trials) were -2.71 mmHg (95% CI -3.49 to -1.93), -2.13 mmHg (95% CI -2.67 to -1.58 ) and -0.24 mmol/l (95% CI -0.32 to -0.16), respectively. The OR for reduction in smoking prevalence (20 trials) was 0.87 (95% CI 0.75 to 1.00). Marked heterogeneity (I2 > 85%) for all risk factor analyses was not explained by co-morbidities, allocation concealment, use of antihypertensive or cholesterol-lowering drugs, or by age of trial.Authors' conclusions: Interventions using counselling and education aimed at behaviour change do not reduce total or CHD mortality or clinical events in general populations but may be effective in reducing mortality in high-risk hypertensive and diabetic populations. Risk factor declines were modest but owing to marked unexplained heterogeneity between trials, the pooled estimates are of dubious validity. Evidence suggests that health promotion interventions have limited use in general populations.US: http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD001561.pub3/abstractRecord #163 of 271ID: CD010442AU: Fryer Caroline EAU: Luker Julie AAU: McDonnell Michelle NAU: Hillier Susan LTI: Self management programmes for quality of life in people with strokeSO: Cochrane Database of Systematic ReviewsYR: 2016NO: 8PB: John Wiley & Sons, LtdKY: Health Behavior;Quality of Life;Stroke Rehabilitation;Health Services Needs and Demand;Independent Living;Self Care [methods];Self Efficacy;Adult[checkword];Humans[checkword]DOI: 10.1002/14651858.CD010442.pub2AB: Background: Stroke results from an acute lack of blood supply to the brain and becomes a chronic health condition for millions of survivors around the world. Self management can offer stroke survivors a pathway to promote their recovery. Self management programmes for people with stroke can include specific education about the stroke and likely effects but essentially, also focusses on skills training to encourage people to take an active part in their management. Such skills training can include problem-solving, goal-setting, decision-making, and coping skills.Objectives: To assess the effects of self management interventions on the quality of life of adults with stroke who are living in the community, compared with inactive or active (usual care) control interventions.Search methods: We searched the following databases from inception to April 2016: the Cochrane Stroke Group Trials Register, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, PsycINFO, SCOPUS, Web of Science, OTSeeker, OT Search, PEDro, REHABDATA, and DARE. We also searched the following trial registries: ClinicalTrials.gov, Stroke Trials Registry, Current Controlled Trials, World Health Organization, and Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry.Selection criteria: We included randomised controlled trials of adults with stroke living in the community who received self management interventions. These interventions included more than one component of self management or targeted more than a single domain of change, or both. Interventions were compared with either an inactive control (waiting list or usual care) or active control (alternate intervention such as education only). Measured outcomes included changes in quality of life, self efficacy, activity or participation levels, impairments, health service usage, health behaviours (such as medication adherence or lifestyle behaviours), cost, participant satisfaction, or adverse events.Data collection and analysis: Two review authors independently extracted prespecified data from all included studies and assessed trial quality and risk of bias. We performed meta-analyses where possible to pool results.Main results: We included 14 trials with 1863 participants. Evidence from six studies showed that self management programmes improved quality of life in people with stroke (standardised mean difference (SMD) random effects 0.34, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.05 to 0.62, P = 0.02; moderate quality evidence) and improved self efficacy (SMD, random effects 0.33, 95% CI 0.04 to 0.61, P = 0.03; low quality evidence) compared with usual care. Individual studies reported benefits for health-related behaviours such as reduced use of health services, smoking, and alcohol intake, as well as improved diet and attitude. However, there was no superior effect for such programmes in the domains of locus of control, activities of daily living, medication adherence, participation, or mood. Statistical heterogeneity was mostly low; however, there was much variation in the types and delivery of programmes. Risk of bias was relatively low for complex intervention clinical trials where participants and personnel could not be blinded.Authors' conclusions: The current evidence indicates that self management programmes may benefit people with stroke who are living in the community. The benefits of such programmes lie in improved quality of life and self efficacy. These are all well-recognised goals for people after stroke. There is evidence for many modes of delivery and examples of tailoring content to the target group. Leaders were usually professionals but peers (stroke survivors and carers) were also reported - the commonality is being trained and expert in stroke and its consequences.

Studies of the effectiveness of these programmes have not been reviewed and synthesised.Objectives: To conduct a systematic review of studies examining the effectiveness of MDRPs in terms of maintaining or improving the physical and psychosocial well-being of adult cancer survivors.Search methods: We conducted electronic searches in the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL and PsychINFO up to February 2012.Selection criteria: Selection criteria focused on randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of multidimensional interventions for adult cancer survivors. Interventions had to include a physical component and a psychosocial component and to have been carried out on two or more occasions following completion of primary cancer treatment. Outcomes had to be assessed using validated measures of physical health and psychosocial well-being. Non-English language papers were included.Data collection and analysis: Pairs of review authors independently selected trials, rated their methodological quality and extracted relevant data. Although meta-analyses of primary and secondary endpoints were planned there was a high level of study heterogeneity and only one common outcome measure (SF-36) could be statistically synthesised. In addition, we conducted a narrative analysis of interventions, particularly in terms of inspecting and identifying intervention components, grouping or categorising interventions and examining potential common links and outcomes.Main results: Twelve RCTs (comprising 1669 participants) met the eligibility criteria. We judged five studies to have a moderate risk of bias and assessed the remaining seven as having a high risk of bias. It was possible to include SF-36 physical health component scores from five studies in a meta-analysis. Participating in a MDRP was associated with an increase in SF-36 physical health component scores (mean difference (MD) 2.22, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.12 to 4.31, P = 0.04). The findings from the narrative analysis suggested that MDRPs with a single domain or outcome focus appeared to be more successful than programmes with multiple aims. In addition, programmes that comprised participants with different types of cancer compared to cancer site-specific programmes were more likely to show positive improvements in physical outcomes. The most effective mode of service delivery appeared to be face-to-face contact supplemented with at least one follow-up telephone call. There was no evidence to indicate that MDRPs which lasted longer than six months improved outcomes beyond the level attained at six months. In addition, there was no evidence to suggest that services were more effective if they were delivered by a particular type of health professional.Authors' conclusions: There is some evidence to support the effectiveness of brief, focused MDRPs for cancer survivors. Rigorous and methodologically sound clinical trials that include an economic analysis are required.US: http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD007730.pub2/abstractRecord #165 of 271ID: CD009518AU: Qin YuAU: Niu KaiAU: Zeng YuanAU: Liu PengAU: Yi LongAU: Zhang TingAU: Zhang Qian YongAU: Zhu Jun DongAU: Mi Man TianTI: Isoflavones for hypercholesterolaemia in adultsSO: Cochrane Database of Systematic ReviewsYR: 2013NO: 6PB: John Wiley & Sons, LtdKY: Hypercholesterolemia [drug therapy];Isoflavones [adverse effects] [therapeutic use];Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic;Soybean Proteins [therapeutic use];Adult[checkword];Aged[checkword];Aged, 80 and over[checkword];Female[checkword];Humans[checkword];Middle Aged[checkword]CC: ENDOCDOI: 10.1002/14651858.CD009518.pub2AB: Background: Hypercholesterolaemia is a significant risk factor for cardiovascular diseases. Isoflavones may be effective in improving hypercholesterolaemia.Objectives: To assess the effects of isoflavones for hypercholesterolaemia.Search methods: We searched the following databases: The Cochrane Library (Issue 9, 2012), MEDLINE, EMBASE, Chinese BioMedical Database and China National Knowledge Infrastructure (all to September 2012).Selection criteria: We considered randomized controlled clinical trials in hypercholesterolaemic participants comparing isoflavones versus placebo, or soy isolated protein added with isoflavones versus soy isolated protein alone.Data collection and analysis: Two review authors independently abstracted relevant population and intervention characteristics. We resolved any disagreements through discussion, or if required by a third party. We assessed the risk of bias of trials against key criteria: random sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding of participants and personnel, blinding of outcome assessment, incomplete outcome data, selective reporting and other sources of bias.Main results: We included five randomized trials (208 participants, 104 in the intervention group and 104 in the control group). Interventions ranged from three to six months. Four trials reported results in non-Asian populations published in English. One trial reported results in Chinese people published in Chinese. Overall, the risk of bias of included trials was high or unclear. There were no outcome data on death from any cause, morbidity, complications, health-related quality of life and costs. Two trials reported adverse effects, including gastrointestinal discomfort (bloating and constipation) and an increased number of hot flushes. None of the trials found serious adverse events. There was a slight significant effect on triglycerides in favour of isoflavones when compared with placebo (mean difference (MD) -0.46 mmol/L (95% confidence interval (CI) -0.84 to -0.09; P = 0.02; 52 participants; 2 trials). No statistically significant effects on total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol were shown in favour of isoflavones.Authors' conclusions: We found no evidence for effects of isoflavones on patient-important outcomes or lowering of cholesterol levels in people with hypercholesterolaemia. Our findings have to be interpreted with caution due to high or unclear risk of bias in several risk of bias domains, and low number of participants in trials.US: http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD009518.pub2/abstractRecord #166 of 271ID: CD008540AU: Middleton PhilippaAU: Crowther Caroline AAU: Simmonds LucyTI: Different intensities of glycaemic control for pregnant women with pre-existing diabetesSO: Cochrane Database of Systematic ReviewsYR: 2016NO: 5PB: John Wiley & Sons, LtdKY: Blood Glucose [metabolism];Diabetes Mellitus, Type 1 [blood] [therapy];Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2 [blood];Fasting [blood];Hemoglobin A, Glycosylated [metabolism];Hyperglycemia [blood] [therapy];Hypoglycemic Agents [therapeutic use];Insulin [therapeutic use];Pregnancy in Diabetics [blood] [therapy];Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic;Reference Values;Female[checkword];Humans[checkword];Infant, Newborn[checkword];Pregnancy[checkword]DOI: 10.1002/14651858.CD008540.pub4AB: Background: The optimal glycaemic control target in pregnant women with pre-existing diabetes is unclear, although there is a clear link between high glucose concentrations and adverse birth outcomes.Objectives: To assess the effects of different intensities of glycaemic control in pregnant women with pre-existing type 1 or type 2 diabetes.Search methods: We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (31 January 2016) and planned to search reference lists of retrieved studies.Selection criteria: We included randomised controlled trials comparing different glycaemic control targets in pregnant women with pre-existing diabetes.Data collection and analysis: Two review authors independently assessed trials for inclusion, conducted data extraction, assessed risk of bias and checked for accuracy. We assessed the quality of the evidence using the GRADE approach.Main results: We included three trials, all in women with type 1 diabetes (223 women and babies). All three trials were at high risk of bias due to lack of blinding, unclear methods of randomisation and selective reporting of outcomes. Two trials compared very tight (3.33 to 5.0 mmol/L fasting blood glucose (FBG)) with tight-moderate (4.45 to 6.38 mmol/L) glycaemic control targets, with one trial of 22 babies reporting no perinatal deaths orserious perinatal morbidity (evidence graded low for both outcomes). In the same trial, there were two congenital anomalies in the very tight, and none in the tight-moderate group, with no significant differences in caesarean section between groups (risk ratio (RR) 0.92, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.49 to 1.73; evidence graded very low). In these two trials, glycaemic control was not significantly different between the very tight and tight-moderate groups by the third trimester, although one trial of 22 women found significantly less maternal hypoglycaemia in the tight-moderate group.In a trial of 60 women and babies comparing tight (≤ 5.6 mmol/L FBG); moderate (5.6 to 6.7 mmol/L); and loose (6.7 to 8.9 mmol/L) glycaemic control targets, there were two neonatal deaths in the loose and none in the tight or moderate groups (evidence graded very low). There were significantly fewer women with pre-eclampsia (evidence graded low), fewer caesarean sections (evidence graded low) and fewer babies with birthweights greater than 90th centile (evidence graded low) in the combined tight-moderate compared with the loose group.The quality of the evidence was graded low or very low for important outcomes, because of design limitations to the studies, the small numbers of women included, and wide confidence intervals crossing the line of no effect. Many of the important outcomes were not reported in these studies.Authors' conclusions: In a very limited body of evidence, few differences in outcomes were seen between very tight and tight-moderate glycaemic control targets in pregnant women with pre-existing type 1 diabetes, including actual glycaemic control achieved. There is evidence of harm (increased pre-eclampsia, caesareans and birthweights greater than 90th centile) for 'loose' control (FBG above 7 mmol/L). Future trials comparing interventions, rather than glycaemic control targets, may be more feasible. Trials in pregnant women with pre-existing type 2 diabetes are required.US: http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD008540.pub4/abstractRecord #167 of 271ID: CD011158AU: Suchdev Parminder SAU: Peña-Rosas Juan PabloAU: De-Regil Luz MariaTI: Multiple micronutrient powders for home (point-of-use) fortification of foods in pregnant womenSO: Cochrane Database of Systematic ReviewsYR: 2015NO: 6PB: John Wiley & Sons, LtdKY: Dietary Supplements;Food, Fortified;Anemia [epidemiology] [therapy];Micronutrients [administration & dosage];Powders;Pregnancy Complications, Hematologic [epidemiology] [therapy];Prenatal Care;Prenatal Nutritional Physiological Phenomena;Prevalence;Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic;Female[checkword];Humans[checkword];Infant, Newborn[checkword];Pregnancy[checkword]CC: PREGDOI: 10.1002/14651858.CD011158.pub2AB: Background: It is estimated that 32 million pregnant women suffer from anaemia worldwide. Due to increased metabolic demands, pregnant women are particularly vulnerable to anaemia and vitamin and mineral deficiencies, leading to adverse health effects in both the mother and her baby. Despite the demonstrated benefits of prenatal supplementation with iron and folic acid or multiple micronutrients, poor adherence to routine supplementation has limited the effectiveness of this intervention in many settings. Micronutrient powders for point-of-use fortification are packed, single-dose sachets containing vitamins and minerals that can be added onto prepared food to improve its nutrient profile. The use of multiple micronutrient powders for point-of-use fortification of foods in pregnant women could be an alternative intervention to prenatal micronutrient supplementation.Objectives: To assess the effects of prenatal home (point-of-use) fortification of foods with multiple micronutrient powders on maternal and newborn health.Search methods: We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (31 January 2015) and the International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) (31 January 2015). We also contacted relevant agencies to identify ongoing and unpublished studies.Selection criteria: Randomised controlled trials (both individual and cluster randomisation) and quasi-randomised trials, irrespective of language or publication status.The intervention was micronutrient powders for point-of-use fortification of foods, containing at least three micronutrients with one of them being iron, provided to pregnant women of any gestational age and parity. Five comparison groups were considered: no intervention/placebo, iron and folic acid supplements, iron-only supplements, folic-acid only supplements, and multiple micronutrients in supplements.Data collection and analysis: Two review authors independently assessed the eligibility of studies, extracted and checked data accuracy, and assessed the risk of bias of included studies.Main results: Our search identified 12 reports (relating to six studies). We included two cluster-randomised controlled trials (involving 1172 women) - these trials were considered to be at a moderate to high risk of bias due to methodological limitations. One trial is ongoing, and three studies were excluded. Micronutrient powders for point-of-use fortification of foods versus iron and folic acid supplementsOne trial (involving 478 pregnant women attending 42 antenatal care centres) compared micronutrient powders containing iron, folic acid, vitamin C and zinc with iron and folic acid tablets provided daily from 14 to 22 weeks to 32 weeks' gestation. The trial did not report on any of this review's primary outcomes: maternal anaemia at or near term, maternal iron deficiency, maternal mortality, adverse effects, low birthweight, preterm births. Nor did the trial report on the majority of this review's secondary outcomes, with the exception of maternal adherence. Adherence to micronutrient powders was lower than adherence to iron and folic acid supplements (risk ratio (RR) 0.76, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.66 to 0.87, one study, n = 405). Micronutrient powders for point-of-use fortification of foods versus same multiple micronutrients in supplementsOne study (involving 694 pregnant women from 18 communities), compared micronutrient powders containing iron, folic acid, vitamin C, zinc, iodine, vitamin E and vitamin B12 with tablets containing the same seven micronutrients. There was no difference in maternal anaemia at 37 weeks of gestation (RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.53 to 1.59, one study, n = 470, very low quality evidence). The trial did not report on any of this review's other primary outcomes in relation to maternal iron deficiency, maternal mortality, adverse effects, low birthweight, or preterm birth. In terms of this review's secondary outcomes, the included trial did not report on the majority of this review's prespecified secondary outcomes with one exception - there was no clear difference in maternal haemoglobin Hb or near term (mean difference (MD) 1.0 g/L, 95% CI -1.77 to 3.77, one study, n = 470).Authors' conclusions: Limited evidence suggests that micronutrient powders for point-of-use fortification of foods have no clear difference as multiple micronutrient supplements on maternal anaemia (very low quality evidence) and Hb at or near term. There is limited evidence to suggest that women were more likely to adhere to taking tablets than using micronutrient powders.The overall quality of evidence was judged very low (due to methodological limitations), and no evidence was available for the majority of primary and secondary outcomes. Therefore, more evidence is needed to assess the potential benefits or harms of the use of micronutrient powders in pregnant women on maternal and infant health outcomes. Future trials should also assess adherence to micronutrient powders and be adequately powered to evaluate the effects on birth outcomes and morbidity.US: http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD011158.pub2/abstractRecord #168 of 271ID: CD011761AU: Harding Kimberly BAU: Peña-Rosas Juan PabloAU: Webster Angela CAU: Yap Constance MYAU: Payne Brian AAU: Ota ErikaAU: De-Regil Luz MariaTI: Iodine supplementation for women during the preconception, pregnancy and postpartum periodSO: Cochrane Database of Systematic ReviewsYR: 2017NO: 3PB: John Wiley & Sons, LtdDOI: 10.1002/14651858.CD011761.pub2AB: Background: Iodine is an essential nutrient required for the biosynthesis of thyroid hormones, which are responsible for regulating growth, development and metabolism. Iodine requirements increase substantially during pregnancy and breastfeeding. If requirements are not met during these periods, the production of thyroid hormones may decrease and be inadequate for maternal, fetal and infant needs. The provision of iodine supplements may help meet the increased iodine needs during pregnancy and the postpartum period and prevent or correct iodine deficiency and its consequences.Objectives: To assess the benefits and harms of supplementation with iodine, alone or in combination with other vitamins and minerals, for women in the preconceptional, pregnancy or postpartum period on their and their children's outcomes.Search methods: We searched Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth's Trials Register (14 November 2016), and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) (17 November 2016), contacted experts in the field and searched the reference lists of retrieved studies and other relevant papers.Selection criteria: Randomized and quasi-randomized controlled trials with randomisation at either the individual or cluster level comparing injected or oral iodine supplementation (such as tablets, capsules, drops) during preconception, pregnancy or the postpartum period irrespective of iodine compound, dose, frequency or duration.Data collection and analysis: Two review authors independently assessed trial eligibility, risk of bias, extracted data and conducted checks for accuracy. We used the GRADE approach to assess the quality of the evidence for primary outcomes.We anticipated high heterogeneity among trials, and we pooled trial results using random-effects models and were cautious in our interpretation of the pooled results.Main results: We included 14 studies and excluded 48 studies. We identified five ongoing or unpublished studies and two studies are awaiting classification. Eleven trials involving over 2700 women contributed data for the comparisons in this review (in three trials, the primary or secondary outcomes were not reported). Maternal primary outcomesIodine supplementation decreased the likelihood of the adverse effect of postpartum hyperthyroidism by 68% (average risk ratio (RR) 0.32; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.11 to 0.91, three trials in mild to moderate iodine deficiency settings, 543 women, no statistical heterogeneity, low-quality evidence) and increased the likelihood of the adverse effect of digestive intolerance in pregnancy by 15 times (average RR 15.33; 95% CI 2.07 to 113.70, one trial in a mild-deficiency setting, 76 women, very low-quality evidence).There were no clear differences between groups for hypothyroidism in pregnancy or postpartum (pregnancy: average RR 1.90; 95% CI 0.57 to 6.38, one trial, 365 women, low-quality evidence, and postpartum: average RR 0.44; 95% CI 0.06 to 3.42, three trials, 540 women, no statistical heterogeneity, low-quality evidence), preterm birth (average RR 0.71; 95% CI 0.30 to 1.66, two trials, 376 women, statistical heterogeneity, low-quality evidence) or the maternal adverse effects of elevated thyroid peroxidase antibodies (TPO-ab) in pregnancy or postpartum (average RR 0.95; 95% CI 0.44 to 2.07, one trial, 359 women, low-quality evidence, average RR 1.01; 95% CI 0.78 to 1.30, three trials, 397 women, no statistical heterogeneity, low-quality evidence), or hyperthyroidism in pregnancy (average RR 1.90; 95% CI 0.57 to 6.38, one trial, 365 women, low-quality evidence). All of the trials contributing data to these outcomes took place in settings with mild to moderate iodine deficiency. Infant/child primary outcomesCompared with those who did not receive iodine, those who received iodine supplements had a 34% lower likelihood of perinatal mortality, however this difference was not statistically significant (average RR 0.66; 95% CI 0.42 to 1.03, two trials, 457 assessments, low-quality evidence). All of the perinatal deaths occurred in one trial conducted in a severely iodine-deficient setting. There were no clear differences between groups for low birthweight (average RR 0.56; 95% CI 0.26 to 1.23, two trials, 377 infants, no statistical heterogeneity, low-quality evidence), neonatal hypothyroidism/elevated thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) (average RR 0.58; 95% CI 0.11 to 3.12, two trials, 260 infants, very low-quality evidence) or the adverse effect of elevated neonatal thyroid peroxidase antibodies (TPO-ab) (average RR 0.61; 95% CI 0.07 to 5.70, one trial, 108 infants, very low-quality evidence). All of the trials contributing data to these outcomes took place in areas with mild to moderate iodine deficiency. No trials reported on hypothyroidism/elevated TSH or any adverse effect beyond the neonatal period.Authors' conclusions: There were insufficient data to reach any meaningful conclusions on the benefits and harms of routine iodine supplementation in women before, during or after pregnancy. The available evidence suggested that iodine supplementation decreases the likelihood of postpartum hyperthyroidism and increases the likelihood of the adverse effect of digestive intolerance in pregnancy - both considered potential adverse effects. We considered evidence for these outcomes low or very low quality, however, because of study design limitations and wide confidence intervals. In addition, due to the small number of trials and included women in our meta-analyses, these findings must be interpreted with caution. There were no clear effects on other important maternal or child outcomes though these findings must also be interpreted cautiously due to limited data and low-quality trials. Additionally, almost all of the evidence came from settings with mild or moderate iodine deficiency and therefore may not be applicable to settings with severe deficiency.More high-quality randomised controlled trials are needed on iodine supplementation before, during and after pregnancy on maternal and infant/child outcomes. However, it may be unethical to compare iodine to placebo or no treatment in severe deficiency settings. Trials may also be unfeasible in settings where pregnant and lactating women commonly take prenatal supplements with iodine. Information is needed on optimal timing of initiation as well as supplementation regimen and dose. Future trials should consider the outcomes in this review and follow children beyond the neonatal period. Future trials should employ adequate sample sizes, assess potential adverse effects (including the nature and extent of digestive intolerance), and be reported in a way that allows assessment of risk of bias, full data extraction and analysis by the subgroups specified in this review.US: http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD011761.pub2/abstractRecord #169 of 271ID: CD009874AU: Hartley LouiseAU: Igbinedion EwemadeAU: Holmes JenniferAU: Flowers NadineAU: Thorogood MargaretAU: Clarke AileenAU: Stranges SaverioAU: Hooper LeeAU: Rees KarenTI: Increased consumption of fruit and vegetables for the primary prevention of cardiovascular diseasesSO: Cochrane Database of Systematic ReviewsYR: 2013NO: 6PB: John Wiley & Sons, LtdKY: Fruit [adverse effects];Vegetables [adverse effects];Cardiovascular Diseases [prevention & control];Consumer Health Information;Halitosis [etiology];Odorants;Primary Prevention [methods];Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic;Adult[checkword];Humans[checkword]DOI: 10.1002/14651858.CD009874.pub2AB: Background: There is increasing evidence that high consumption of fruit and vegetables is beneficial for cardiovascular disease (CVD) prevention.Objectives: The primary objective is to determine the effectiveness of i) advice to increase fruit and vegetable consumption ii) the provision of fruit and vegetables to increase consumption, for the primary prevention of CVD. Search methods: We searched the following electronic databases: The Cochrane Library (2012, issue 9-CENTRAL, HTA, DARE, NEED), MEDLINE (1946 to week 3 September 2012); EMBASE (1980 to 2012 week 39) and the Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science on ISI Web of Science (5 October 2012). We searched trial registers, screened reference lists and contacted authors for additional information where necessary. No language restrictions were applied.Selection criteria: Randomised controlled trials with at least three months follow-up (follow-up was considered to be the time elapsed since the start of the intervention) involving healthy adults or those at high risk of CVD. Trials investigated either advice to increase fruit and vegetable intake (via any source or modality) or the provision of fruit and vegetables to increase intake. The comparison group was no intervention or minimal intervention. Outcomes of interest were CVD clinical events (mortality (CVD and all-cause), myocardial infarction (MI), coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) or percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA), angiographically-defined angina pectoris, stroke, carotid endarterectomy, peripheral arterial disease (PAD)) and major CVD risk factors (blood pressure, blood lipids, type 2 diabetes). Trials involving multifactorial lifestyle interventions (including different dietary patterns, exercise) or where the focus was weight loss were excluded to avoid confounding.Data collection and analysis: Two review authors independently selected trials for inclusion, extracted data and assessed the risk of bias. Trials of provision of fruit and vegetables were analysed separately from trials of dietary advice.Main results: We identified 10 trials with a total of 1730 participants randomised, and one ongoing trial. Six trials investigated the provision of fruit and vegetables, and four trials examined advice to increase fruit and vegetable consumption.The ongoing trial is examining the provision of an avocado-rich diet.The number and type of intervention components for provision, and the dietary advice provided differed between trials.None of the trials reported clinical events as they were all relatively short term. There was no strong evidence for effects of individual trials of provision of fruit and vegetables on cardiovascular risk factors, but trials were heterogeneous and short term. Furthermore, five of the six trials only provided one fruit or vegetable. Dietary advice showed some favourable effects on blood pressure (systolic blood pressure (SBP): mean difference (MD) -3.0 mmHg (95% confidence interval (CI) -4.92 to -1.09), diastolic blood pressure (DBP): MD -0.90 mmHg (95% CI -2.03 to 0.24)) and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol but analyses were based on only two trials. Three of the 10 included trials examined adverse effects, which included increased bowel movements, bad breath and body odour.Authors' conclusions: There are very few studies to date examining provision of, or advice to increase the consumption of, fruit and vegetables in the absence of additional dietary interventions or other lifestyle interventions for the primary prevention of CVD. The limited evidence suggests advice to increase fruit and vegetables as a single intervention has favourable effects on CVD risk factors but more trials are needed to confirm this.US: http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD009874.pub2/abstractRecord #170 of 271ID: CD008919AU: Magalhães Pedro V SAU: Dean OliviaAU: Andreazza Ana CAU: Berk MichaelAU: Kapczinski FlávioTI: Antioxidant treatments for schizophreniaSO: Cochrane Database of Systematic ReviewsYR: 2016NO: 2PB: John Wiley & Sons, LtdKY: Acetylcysteine [therapeutic use];Allopurinol [therapeutic use];Antioxidants [therapeutic use];Antipsychotic Agents [therapeutic use];Ascorbic Acid [therapeutic use];Dehydroepiandrosterone [therapeutic use];Drug Therapy, Combination [methods];Free Radical Scavengers [therapeutic use];Ginkgo biloba;Oxidative Stress [drug effects];Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic;Schizophrenia [drug therapy] [metabolism];Selegiline [therapeutic use];Vitamin E [therapeutic use];Vitamins [therapeutic use];Humans[checkword]CC: SCHIZDOI: 10.1002/14651858.CD008919.pub2AB: Background: There is accumulating evidence that progressive changes in brain structure and function take place as schizophrenia unfolds. Among many possible candidates, oxidative stress may be one of the mediators of neuroprogression, grey matter loss and subsequent cognitive and functional impairment. Antioxidants are exogenous or endogenous molecules that mitigate any form of oxidative stress or its consequences. They may act from directly scavenging free radicals to increasing anti-oxidative defences. There is evidence that current treatments impact oxidative pathways and may to some extent reverse pro-oxidative states in schizophrenia. The existing literature, however, indicates that these treatments do not fully restore the deficits in antioxidant levels or restore levels of oxidants in schizophrenia. As such, there has been interest in developing interventions aimed at restoring this oxidative balance beyond the benefits of antipsychotics in this direction. If antioxidants are to have a place in the treatment of this serious condition, the relevant and up-to-date information should be available to clinicians and investigators.Objectives: To evaluate the effect of antioxidants as add-on treatments to standard antipsychotic medication for improving acute psychotic episodes and core symptoms, and preventing relapse in people with schizophrenia.Search methods: We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group’s Study-Based Register of Trials which is based on regular searches of CINAHL, BIOSIS, AMED, Embase, PubMed, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, and registries of clinical trials. There are no language, time, document type, or publication status limitations for inclusion of records in the register. We ran this search in November 2010, and again on 8 January 2015. We also inspected references of all identified studies for further trials and contacted authors of trials for additional information.Selection criteria: We included reports if they were randomised controlled trials (RCTs) involving people with schizophrenia who had been allocated to either a substance with antioxidant potential or to a placebo as an adjunct to standard antipsychotic treatment.Data collection and analysis: We independently extracted data from these trials and we estimated risk ratios (RR) or mean differences (MD), with 95% confidence intervals (CI). We assessed risk of bias for included studies and created a 'Summary of findings' table using GRADE.Main results: The review includes 22 RCTs of varying quality and sample size studying Ginkgo biloba, N-acetyl cysteine (NAC), allopurinol, dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), vitamin C, vitamin E or selegiline. Median follow-up was eight weeks. Only three studies including a minority of the participants reported our a priori selected primary outcome of clinically important response. Short-term data for this outcome (measured as at least 20% improvement in scores on Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS)) were similar (3 RCTs, n = 229, RR 0.77, 95% CI 0.53 to 1.12, low quality evidence). Studies usually reported only endpoint psychopathology rating scale scores. Psychotic symptoms were lower in those using an adjunctive antioxidant according to the PANSS ( 7 RCTS, n = 584, MD -6.00, 95% CI -10.35 to -1.65, very low quality evidence) and the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) (8 RCTS, n = 843, MD -3.20, 95% CI -5.63 to -0.78, low quality evidence). There was no overall short-term difference in leaving the study early (16 RCTs, n = 1584, RR 0.73, 95% CI 0.48 to 1.11, moderate quality evidence), or in general functioning (2 RCTs, n = 52, MD -1.11, 95% CI -8.07 to 5.86, low quality evidence). Adverse events were generally poorly reported. Three studies reported useable data for 'any serious adverse effect', results were equivocal (3 RCTs, n = 234, RR 0.65, 95% CI 0.19 to 2.27, low quality evidence). No evidence was available for relapse, quality of life or service use.Authors' conclusions: Although 22 trials could be included in this review, the evidence provided is limited and mostly not relevant to clinicians or consumers. Overall, although there was low risk of attrition and selective data reporting bias within the trials, the trials themselves were not adequately powered and need more substantial follow-up periods. There is a need for larger trials with longer periods of follow-up to be conducted. Outcomes should be meaningful for those with schizophrenia, and include measures of improvement and relapse (not just rating scale scores), functioning and quality of life and acceptability and, importantly, safety data.US: http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD008919.pub2/abstractRecord #171 of 271ID: CD002115AU: Coggrave MaureenAU: Norton ChristineAU: Cody June DTI: Management of faecal incontinence and constipation in adults with central neurological diseasesSO: Cochrane Database of Systematic ReviewsYR: 2014NO: 1PB: John Wiley & Sons, LtdKY: Central Nervous System Diseases [complications];Cisapride [therapeutic use];Constipation [etiology] [therapy];Fecal Incontinence [etiology] [therapy];Gastrointestinal Agents [therapeutic use];Parkinson Disease [complications];Psyllium [therapeutic use];Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic;Spinal Cord Injuries [complications];Humans[checkword]CC: INCONTDOI: 10.1002/14651858.CD002115.pub5AB: Background: People with central neurological disease or injury have a much higher risk of both faecal incontinence and constipation than the general population. There is often a fine line between the two symptoms, with any management intended to ameliorate one risking precipitating the other. Bowel problems are observed to be the cause of much anxiety and may reduce quality of life in these people. Current bowel management is largely empirical, with a limited research base. This is an update of a Cochrane review first published in 2001 and subsequently updated in 2003 and 2006. The review is relevant to individuals with any disease directly and chronically affecting the central nervous system (post-traumatic, degenerative, ischaemic or neoplastic), such as multiple sclerosis, spinal cord injury, cerebrovascular disease, Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease.Objectives: To determine the effects of management strategies for faecal incontinence and constipation in people with a neurological disease or injury affecting the central nervous system.Search methods: We searched the Cochrane Incontinence Group Trials Register (searched 8 June 2012), which includes searches of the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE and MEDLINE In-Process as well as handsearching of journals and conference proceedings; and all reference lists of relevant articles.Selection criteria: Randomised and quasi-randomised trials evaluating any type of conservative or surgical intervention for the management of faecal incontinence and constipation in people with central neurological disease or injury were selected. Specific therapies for the treatment of neurological diseases that indirectly affect bowel dysfunction were also considered.Data collection and analysis: At least two review authors independently assessed the risk of bias of eligible trials and independently extracted data from the included trials using a range of pre-specified outcome measures.Main results: Twenty trials involving 902 people were included.Oral medicationsThere was evidence from individual small trials that people with Parkinson's disease had a statistically significant improvement in the number of bowel motions or successful bowel care routines per week when fibre (psyllium) (mean difference (MD) -2.2 bowel motions, 95% confidence interval (CI) -3.3 to -1.4) or oral laxative (isosmotic macrogol electrolyte solution) (MD 2.9 bowel motions per week, 95% CI 1.48 to 4.32) are used compared with placebo. One trial in people with spinal cord injury showed statistically significant improvement in total bowel care time comparing intramuscular neostigmine-glycopyrrolate (anticholinesterase plus an anticholinergic drug) with placebo (MD 23.3 minutes, 95% CI 4.68 to 41.92).Five studies reported the use of cisapride and tegaserod in people with spinal cord injuries or Parkinson's disease. These drugs have since been withdrawn from the market due to adverse effects; as they are no longer available they have been removed from this review.Rectal stimulantsOne small trial in people with spinal cord injuries compared two bisacodyl suppositories, one polyethylene glycol-based (PGB) and one hydrogenated vegetable oil-based (HVB). The trial found that the PGB bisacodyl suppository significantly reduced the mean defaecation period (PGB 20 minutes versus HVB 36 minutes, P < 0.03) and mean total time for bowel care (PGB 43 minutes versus HVB 74.5 minutes, P < 0.01) compared with the HVB bisacodyl suppository.Physical interventionsThere was evidence from one small trial with 31 participants that abdominal massage statistically improved the number of bowel motions in people who had a stroke compared with no massage (MD 1.7 bowel motions per week, 95% CI 2.22 to 1.18). A small feasibility trial including 30 individuals with multiple sclerosis also found evidence to support the use of abdominal massage. Constipation scores were statistically better with the abdominal massage during treatment although this was not supported by a change in outcome measures (for example the neurogenic bowel dysfunction score).One small trial in people with spinal cord injury showed statistically significant improvement in total bowel care time using electrical stimulation of abdominal muscles compared with no electrical stimulation (MD 29.3 minutes, 95% CI 7.35 to 51.25).There was evidence from one trial with a low risk of bias that for people with spinal cord injury transanal irrigation, compared against conservative bowel care, statistically improved constipation scores, neurogenic bowel dysfunction score, faecal incontinence score and total time for bowel care (MD 27.4 minutes, 95% CI 7.96 to 46.84). Patients were also more satisfied with this method.Other interventionsIn one trial in stroke patients, there appeared to be a short term benefit (less than six months) to patients in terms of the number of bowel motions per week with a one-off educational intervention from nurses (a structured nurse assessment leading to targeted education versus routine care), but this did not persist at 12 months. A trial in individuals with spinal cord injury found that a stepwise protocol did not reduce the need for oral laxatives and manual evacuation of stool.Finally, one further trial reported in abstract form showed that oral carbonated water (rather than tap water) improved constipation scores in people who had had a stroke.Authors' conclusions: There is still remarkably little research on this common and, to patients, very significant issue of bowel management. The available evidence is almost uniformly of low methodological quality. The clinical significance of some of the research findings presented here is difficult to interpret, not least because each intervention has only been addressed in individual trials, against control rather than compared against each other, and the interventions are very different from each other.There was very limited evidence from individual trials in favour of a bulk-forming laxative (psyllium), an isosmotic macrogol laxative, abdominal massage, electrical stimulation and an anticholinesterase-anticholinergic drug combination (neostigmine-glycopyrrolate) compared to no treatment or controls. There was also evidence in favour of transanal irrigation (compared to conservative management), oral carbonated (rather than tap) water and abdominal massage with lifestyle advice (compared to lifestyle advice alone). However, these findings need to be confirmed by larger well-designed controlled trials which should include evaluation of the acceptability of the intervention to patients and the effect on their quality of life.US: http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD002115.pub5/abstractRecord #172 of 271ID: CD011740AU: Ells Louisa JAU: Mead EmmaAU: Atkinson GregAU: Corpeleijn EvaAU: Roberts KatharineAU: Viner RussellAU: Baur LouiseAU: Metzendorf Maria-IntiAU: Richter BerndTI: Surgery for the treatment of obesity in children and adolescentsSO: Cochrane Database of Systematic ReviewsYR: 2015NO: 6PB: John Wiley & Sons, LtdKY: Australia;Gastroplasty [methods];Life Style;Pediatric Obesity [surgery];Quality of Life;Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic;Weight Loss;Adolescent[checkword];Child[checkword];Female[checkword];Humans[checkword];Male[checkword]DOI: 10.1002/14651858.CD011740AB: Background: Child and adolescent overweight and obesity have increased globally, and are associated with significant short and long term health consequences.Objectives: To assess the effects of surgical interventions for treating obesity in childhood and adolescence.Search methods: We searched the Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, PubMed, EMBASE as well as LILACS, ICTRP Search Portal and ClinicalTrials.gov (all from database inception to March 2015). References of identified studies and systematic reviews were checked. No language restrictions were applied.Selection criteria: We selected randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of surgical interventions for treating obesity in children and adolescents (age < 18 years) with a minimum of six months follow-up. Interventions that specifically dealt with the treatment of eating disorders or type 2 diabetes, or included participants with a secondary or syndromic cause of obesity were excluded. Pregnant females were also excluded.Data collection and analysis: Two review authors independently assessed risk of bias and extracted data. Where necessary authors were contacted for additional information.Main results: We included one RCT (a total of 50 participants, 25 in both the intervention and comparator group). The intervention focused on laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding surgery, which was compared to a control group receiving a multi component lifestyle programme. The participating population consisted of Australian adolescents (a higher proportion of girls than boys) aged 14 to 18 years, with a mean age of 16.5 and 16.6 years in the gastric banding and lifestyle group, respectively which was conducted in a private hospital, receiving funding from the gastric banding manufacturer. The study authors were unable to blind participants, personnel and outcome assessors which may have resulted in a high risk of performance and detection bias. Attrition bias was noted as well. The study authors reported a mean reduction in weight of 34.6 kg (95% confidence interval (CI) 30.2 to 39.0) at two years, representing a change in body mass index (BMI) of 12.7 (95% CI 11.3 to 14.2) for the surgery intervention; and a mean reduction in weight of 3.0 kg (95% CI 2.1 to 8.1) representing a change in BMI of 1.3 (95% CI 0.4 to 2.9) for the lifestyle intervention. The differences between groups were statistically significant for all weight measures at 24 months (P < 0.001). The overall quality of the evidence according to the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) was low. Adverse events were reported in 12/25 (48%) participants in the intervention group compared to 11/25 (44%) in the control group (low quality evidence). A total of 28% of the adolescents undergoing gastric banding required revisional surgery. No data were reported for all-cause mortality, behaviour change, participants views of the intervention and socioeconomic effects. At two years, the gastric banding group performed better than the lifestyle group in two of eight health-related quality of life concepts (very low quality evidence) as measured by the Child Health Questionnaire (physical functioning score (94 versus 78, community norm 95) and change in health score (4.4 versus 3.6, community norm 3.5)).Authors' conclusions: Laparoscopic gastric banding led to greater body weight loss compared to a multi component lifestyle program in one small study with 50 patients. These results do not provide enough data to assess efficacy across populations from different countries, socioeconomic and ethnic backgrounds, who may respond differently. This systematic review highlights the lack of RCTs in this field. Future studies should assess the impact of the surgical procedure and post operative care to minimise adverse events, including the need for post operative adjustments and revisional surgery. Long-term follow-up is also critical to comprehensively assess the impact of surgery as participants enter adulthood.US: http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD011740/abstractRecord #173 of 271ID: CD000254AU: Evans Jennifer RAU: Lawrenson John GTI: Antioxidant vitamin and mineral supplements for slowing the progression of age-related macular degenerationSO: Cochrane Database of Systematic ReviewsYR: 2012NO: 11PB: John Wiley & Sons, LtdKY: Antioxidants [therapeutic use];Dietary Supplements;Macular Degeneration [prevention & control];Minerals [therapeutic use];Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic;Vitamins [therapeutic use];Aged[checkword];Humans[checkword]CC: EYESDOI: 10.1002/14651858.CD000254.pub3AB: Background: It has been proposed that antioxidants may prevent cellular damage in the retina by reacting with free radicals that are produced in the process of light absorption. Higher dietary levels of antioxidant vitamins and minerals may reduce the risk of progression of age-related macular degeneration (AMD).Objectives: The objective of this review was to assess the effects of antioxidant vitamin or mineral supplementation on the progression of AMD in people with AMD.Search methods: We searched CENTRAL (which contains the Cochrane Eyes and Vision Group Trials Register) (The Cochrane Library 2012, Issue 8), Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid MEDLINE In-Process and Other Non-Indexed Citations, Ovid MEDLINE Daily, Ovid OLDMEDLINE (January 1946 to August 2012), EMBASE (January 1980 to August 2012), Allied and Complementary Medicine Database (AMED) (January 1985 to August 2012), OpenGrey (System for Information on Grey Literature in Europe) (www.opengrey.eu/), the metaRegister of Controlled Trials (mRCT) (www.controlled-trials.com), ClinicalTrials.gov (www.clinicaltrials.gov) and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) (www.who.int/ictrp/search/en). We did not use any date or language restrictions in the electronic searches for trials. We last searched the electronic databases on 20 August 2012. We searched the reference lists of identified reports and the Science Citation Index. We contacted investigators and experts in the field for details of unpublished studies. We also searched for systematic reviews of harms of vitamin supplements.Selection criteria: We included randomised trials comparing antioxidant vitamin or mineral supplementation (alone or in combination) to placebo or no intervention in people with AMD.Data collection and analysis: Two authors assessed risk of bias and extracted data from the included trials. Where appropriate, we pooled data using a random-effects model unless three or fewer trials were available in which case we used a fixed-effect model.Main results: Thirteen trials (6150 participants) were included in this review. Over half the participants (3640) were randomised in one trial (AREDS in the USA), which found a beneficial effect of antioxidant (beta-carotene, vitamin C and vitamin E) and zinc supplementation on progression to advanced AMD (adjusted odds ratio (OR) 0.68, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.53 to 0.87) over an average of 6.3 years. People taking supplements were less likely to lose 15 or more letters of visual acuity (adjusted OR 0.77, 95% CI 0.62 to 0.96). The other trials, in general, had shorter follow-up (less than two years). No evidence for an effect of supplementation was seen in these smaller trials of shorter duration. Overall we considered the strength of the evidence to be moderate. We did not consider included trials, in general, to be at risk of bias, although we found it difficult to assess reporting biases. The main reason for downgrading the strength of the evidence was because, for several analyses, only one trial was included and therefore consistency of the findings could not be assessed. The included trials reported the following adverse effects: hospitalisation for genito-urinary problems was more common in people taking zinc and yellowing of skin was more common in people taking antioxidants. Systematic searching of the literature identified other potential harms of vitamin supplementation, in particular an increased risk of lung cancer in smokers associated with beta-carotene supplements, but we were unable to identify a good systematic review of the evidence for harms of nutritional supplementation.Authors' conclusions: People with AMD may experience delay in progression of the disease with antioxidant vitamin and mineral supplementation. This finding is drawn from one large trial conducted in a relatively well-nourished American population. The generalisability of these findings to other populations is not known. Although generally regarded as safe, vitamin supplements may have harmful effects. A systematic review of the evidence on harms of vitamin supplements is needed.US: http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD000254.pub3/abstractRecord #174 of 271ID: CD010010AU: Teo EdwardAU: House HughAU: Lockhart KathleenAU: Purchuri Sai NavyaAU: Pushparajah JenniferAU: Cripps Allan WAU: van Driel Mieke LTI: Haemophilus influenzae oral vaccination for preventing acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis and chronic obstructive pulmonary diseaseSO: Cochrane Database of Systematic ReviewsYR: 2014NO: 9PB: John Wiley & Sons, LtdKY: Administration, Oral;Anti-Bacterial Agents [administration & dosage];Bronchitis, Chronic [prevention & control];Disease Progression;Haemophilus Vaccines [administration & dosage];Haemophilus influenzae [immunology];Pulmonary Disease, Chronic Obstructive [prevention & control];Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic;Secondary Prevention;Adult[checkword];Aged[checkword];Aged, 80 and over[checkword];Humans[checkword];Middle Aged[checkword]CC: ARIDOI: 10.1002/14651858.CD010010.pub2AB: Background: Chronic bronchitis and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are serious conditions in which patients are predisposed to viral and bacterial infections resulting in potentially fatal acute exacerbations. COPD is defined as a lung disease characterised by obstruction to lung airflow that interferes with normal breathing. Antibiotic therapy has not been particularly useful in eradicating bacteria such as non-typeable Haemophilus influenzae (NTHi) because they are naturally occurring flora of the upper respiratory tract in many people. However, they can cause opportunistic infection. An oral NTHi vaccine has been developed to protect against recurrent infective acute exacerbations in chronic bronchitis.Objectives: To assess the effectiveness of an oral, whole-cell, non-typeable H. influenzae (NTHi) vaccine in protecting against recurrent episodes of acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis and COPD in adults. To assess the effectiveness of NTHi vaccine in reducing NTHi colonising the respiratory tract during recurrent episodes of acute exacerbations of COPD.Search methods: We searched the following databases: CENTRAL (2014, Issue 6), MEDLINE (1946 to July week 3, 2014), EMBASE (1974 to July 2014), CINAHL (1981 to July 2014), LILACS (1982 to July 2014) and Web of Science (1955 to July 2014). We also searched trials registries and contacted authors of trials requesting unpublished data.Selection criteria: We included randomised controlled trials comparing the effects of an oral monobacterial NTHi vaccine in adults with recurrent acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis or COPD when there was overt matching of the vaccine and placebo groups on clinical grounds. The selection criteria considered populations aged less than 65 years and those older than 65 years.Data collection and analysis: Two authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data from original records and publications for incidence and severity of bronchitis episodes and carriage rate of NTHi measured in the upper respiratory tract, as well as data relevant to other primary and secondary outcomes.Main results: We identified six placebo-controlled randomised controlled trials with a total of 557 participants. They investigated the efficacy of enteric-coated, killed preparations of H. influenzae in populations prone to recurrent acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis or COPD. The vaccine preparation and immunisation regime in all trials consisted of at least three courses of formalin-killed H. influenzae in enteric-coated tablets taken at intervals (for example, days 0, 28 and 56). Each course generally consisted of two tablets taken after breakfast over three consecutive days. In all cases the placebo groups took enteric-coated tablets containing glucose. Risk of bias was moderate across the studies, namely due to the lack of information provided about methods and inadequate presentation of results.Meta-analysis of the oral NTHi vaccine showed a small, non-statistically significant reduction in the incidence of acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis or COPD by 2.048% (risk ratio (RR) 0.97, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.84 to 1.12, P value = 0.68). There was no significant difference in mortality rate between the vaccine and placebo groups (odds ratio (OR) 1.62, 95% CI 0.63 to 4.12, P value = 0.31).We were unable to meta-analyse the carriage levels of NTHi in participants as each trial reported this result using different units and tools of measurement. Four trials showed no significant difference in carriage levels, while two trials showed a significant decrease in carriage levels in the vaccinated group compared with placebo.Four trials assessed severity of exacerbations measured by requirement for antibiotics. Three of these trials were comparable and when meta-analysed showed a statistically significant 80% increase in antibiotic courses per person in the placebo group (RR 1.81, 95% CI 1.35 to 2.44, P value < 0.0001). There was no significant difference between the groups with regards to hospital admission rates (OR 0.96, 95% CI 0.13 to 7.04, P value = 0.97). Adverse events were reported in all six trials with a point estimate suggestive that they occurred more frequently in the vaccine group, however, this result was not statistically significant (RR 1.43, 95% CI 0.70 to 2.92, P value = 0.87). Quality of life was not meta-analysed but was reported in two trials, with results at six months showing an improvement in quality of life in the vaccinated group (scoring at least two points better than placebo).Authors' conclusions: Analyses demonstrate that NTHi oral vaccination of patients with recurrent exacerbations of chronic bronchitis or COPD does not yield a significant reduction in the number and severity of exacerbations. Evidence is mixed and the individual trials that show a significant benefit of the vaccine are too small to advocate widespread oral vaccination of people with COPD.US: http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD010010.pub2/abstractRecord #175 of 271ID: CD003516AU: Mangesi LindekaAU: Hofmeyr G JustusTI: Early compared with delayed oral fluids and food after caesarean sectionSO: Cochrane Database of Systematic ReviewsYR: 2002NO: 3PB: John Wiley & Sons, LtdKY: Cesarean Section;Food;Postoperative Care;Administration, Oral;Fluid Therapy [methods];Time Factors;Female[checkword];Humans[checkword];Pregnancy[checkword]CC: PREGDOI: 10.1002/14651858.CD003516AB: Background: It is customary for fluids and/or food to be withheld for a period of time after abdominal operations. After caesarean section, practices vary considerably. These discrepancies raise concern as to the bases of different practices.Objectives: To assess the effect of early versus delayed introduction of fluids and/or food after caesarean section.Search methods: We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group trials register (January 2002) and the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register (The Cochrane Library, Issue 4, 2001).Selection criteria: Clinical trials with random allocation comparing early versus delayed oral fluids and/or food after caesarean section were considered. The participants were women within the first 24 hours after caesarean section. The criteria for 'early' feeding were as defined by the individual trial authors - usually within six to eight hours of surgery.Data collection and analysis: Trials considered were evaluated for methodological quality and appropriateness for inclusion. For dichotomous data, relative risks and 95% confidence intervals were calculated. Continuous data were compared using weighted mean difference and 95% confidence interval. Sub-group analyses were performed for general anaesthesia, regional analgesia and where anaesthesia was mixed or undefined.Main results: Of 12 studies considered, six were included in this review. Four were excluded and two are pending further information. The methodological quality of the studies was variable. Only one to three studies contributed usable data to each outcome. Three studies were limited to surgery under regional analgesia, while three included both regional analgesia and general anaesthesia.Early oral fluids or food were associated with: reduced time to first food intake (one study, 118 women; the intervention was a slush diet and food was introduced according to clinical parameters; weighted mean difference -7.20 hours, 95% confidence interval -13.26 to -1.14); reduced time to return of bowel sounds (one study, 118 women; -4.30 hours, -6.78 to -1.82); reduced postoperative hospital stay following surgery under regional analgesia (two studies, 220 women; -0.75 days, -1.37 to -0.12 - random effects model); and a trend to reduced abdominal distension (three studies, 369 women; relative risk 0.78, 95% confidence interval 0.55 to 1.11). No significant differences were identified with respect to nausea, vomiting, time to bowel action/ passing flatus, paralytic ileus and number of analgesic doses.Authors' conclusions: There was no evidence from the limited randomised trials reviewed, to justify a policy of withholding oral fluids after uncomplicatedcaesarean section. Further research is justified.US: http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD003516/abstractRecord #176 of 271ID: CD009840AU: Baldwin ChristineAU: Kimber Katherine LAU: Gibbs MichelleAU: Weekes Christine ElizabethTI: Supportive interventions for enhancing dietary intake in malnourished or nutritionally at-risk adultsSO: Cochrane Database of Systematic ReviewsYR: 2016NO: 12PB: John Wiley & Sons, LtdKY: Dietary Supplements [adverse effects];Meals;Cause of Death;Dietary Proteins [administration & dosage];Energy Intake;Environment;Hospitalization [statistics & numerical data];Malnutrition [diet therapy] [mortality];Nutritional Status;Quality of Life;Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic;Adult[checkword];Humans[checkword]DOI: 10.1002/14651858.CD009840.pub2AB: Background: Supportive interventions such as serving meals in a dining room environment or the use of assistants to feed patients are frequently recommended for the management of nutritionally vulnerable groups. Such interventions are included in many policy and guideline documents and have implications for staff time but may incur additional costs, yet there appears to be a lack of evidence for their efficacy.Objectives: To assess the effects of supportive interventions for enhancing dietary intake in malnourished or nutritionally at-risk adults.Search methods: We identified publications from comprehensive searches of the Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, Embase, AMED, British Nursing Index, CINAHL, SCOPUS, ISI Web of Science databases, scrutiny of the reference lists of included trials and related systematic reviews and handsearching the abstracts of relevant meetings. The date of the last search for all databases was 31 March 2013. Additional searches of CENTRAL, MEDLINE, ClinicalTrials.gov and WHO ICTRP were undertaken to September 2016. The date of the last search for these databases was 14 September 2016.Selection criteria: Randomised controlled trials of supportive interventions given with the aim of enhancing dietary intake in nutritionally vulnerable adults compared with usual care.Data collection and analysis: Three review authors and for the final search, the editor, selected trials from titles and abstracts and independently assessed eligibility of selected trials. Two review authors independently extracted data and assessed risk of bias, as well as evaluating overall quality of the evidence utilising the GRADE instrument, and then agreed as they entered data into the review. The likelihood of clinical heterogeneity amongst trials was judged to be high as trials were in populations with widely different clinical backgrounds, conducted in different healthcare settings and despite some grouping of similar interventions, involved interventions that varied considerably. We were only able, therefore, to conduct meta-analyses for the outcome measures, 'all-cause mortality', 'hospitalisation' and 'nutritional status (weight change)'.Main results: Forty-one trials (10,681 participants) met the inclusion criteria. Trials were grouped according to similar interventions (changes to organisation of nutritional care (N = 13; 3456 participants), changes to the feeding environment (N = 5; 351 participants), modification of meal profile or pattern (N = 12; 649 participants), additional supplementation of meals (N = 10; 6022 participants) and home meal delivery systems (N = 1; 203 participants). Follow-up ranged from ‘duration of hospital stay’ to 12 months.The overall quality of evidence was moderate to very low, with the majority of trials judged to be at an unclear risk of bias in several risk of bias domains. The risk ratio (RR) for all-cause mortality was 0.78 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.66 to 0.92); P = 0.004; 12 trials; 6683 participants; moderate-quality evidence. This translates into 26 (95% CI 9 to 41) fewer cases of death per 1000 participants in favour of supportive interventions. The RR for number of participants with any medical complication ranged from 1.42 in favour of control compared with 0.59 in favour of supportive interventions (very low-quality evidence). Only five trials (4451 participants) investigated health-related quality of life showing no substantial differences between intervention and comparator groups. Information on patient satisfaction was unreliable. The effects of supportive interventions versus comparators on hospitalisation showed a mean difference (MD) of -0.5 days (95% CI -2.6 to 1.6); P = 0.65; 5 trials; 667 participants; very low-quality evidence. Only three of 41 included trials (4108 participants; very low-quality evidence) reported on adverse events, describing intolerance to the supplement (diarrhoea, vomiting; 5/34 participants) and discontinuation of oral nutritional supplements because of refusal or dislike of taste (567/2017 participants). Meta-analysis across 17 trials with adequate data on weight change revealed an overall improvement in weight in favour of supportive interventions versus control: MD 0.6 kg (95% CI 0.21 to 1.02); 2024 participants; moderate-quality evidence. A total of 27 trials investigated nutritional intake with a majority of trials not finding marked differences in energy intake between intervention and comparator groups. Only three trials (1152 participants) reported some data on economic costs but did not use accepted health economic methods (very low-quality evidence).Authors' conclusions: There is evidence of moderate to very low quality to suggest that supportive interventions to improve nutritional care results in minimal weight gain. Most of the evidence for the lower risk of all-cause mortality for supportive interventions comes from hospital-based trials and more research is needed to confirm this effect. There is very low-quality evidence regarding adverse effects; therefore whilst some of these interventions are advocated at a national level clinicians should recognise the lack of clear evidence to support their role.

It can exacerbate the experience of other symptoms, negatively affect mood, interfere with the ability to carry out everyday activities, and negatively impact on quality of life. Educational interventions may help people to manage this fatigue or to cope with this symptom, and reduce its overall burden. Despite the importance of education for managing cancer-related fatigue there are currently no systematic reviews examining this approach.Objectives: To determine the effectiveness of educational interventions for managing cancer-related fatigue in adults.Search methods: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), and MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, PsycINFO, ERIC, OTseeker and PEDro up to 1st November 2016. We also searched trials registries.Selection criteria: We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of educational interventions focused on cancer-related fatigue where fatigue was a primary outcome. Studies must have aimed to evaluate the effect of educational interventions designed specifically to manage cancer-related fatigue, or to evaluate educational interventions targeting a constellation of physical symptoms or quality of life where fatigue was the primary focus. The studies could have compared educational interventions with no intervention or wait list controls, usual care or attention controls, or an alternative intervention for cancer-related fatigue in adults with any type of cancer.Data collection and analysis: Two review authors independently screened studies for inclusion and extracted data. We resolved differences in opinion by discussion. Trial authors were contacted for additional information. A third independent person checked the data extraction. The main outcome considered in this review was cancer-related fatigue. We assessed the evidence using GRADE and created a 'Summary of Findings' table.Main results: We included 14 RCTs with 2213 participants across different cancer diagnoses. Four studies used only 'information-giving' educational strategies, whereas the remainder used mainly information-giving strategies coupled with some problem-solving, reinforcement, or support techniques. Interventions differed in delivery including: mode of delivery (face to face, web-based, audiotape, telephone); group or individual interventions; number of sessions provided (ranging from 2 to 12 sessions); and timing of intervention in relation to completion of cancer treatment (during or after completion). Most trials compared educational interventions to usual care and meta-analyses compared educational interventions to usual care or attention controls. Methodological issues that increased the risk of bias were evident including lack of blinding of outcome assessors, unclear allocation concealment in over half of the studies, and generally small sample sizes. Using the GRADE approach, we rated the quality of evidence as very low to moderate, downgraded mainly due to high risk of bias, unexplained heterogeneity, and imprecision.There was moderate quality evidence of a small reduction in fatigue intensity from a meta-analyses of eight studies (1524 participants; standardised mean difference (SMD) -0.28, 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.52 to -0.04) comparing educational interventions with usual care or attention control. We found low quality evidence from twelve studies (1711 participants) that educational interventions had a small effect on general/overall fatigue (SMD -0.27, 95% CI -0.51 to -0.04) compared to usual care or attention control. There was low quality evidence from three studies (622 participants) of a moderate size effect of educational interventions for reducing fatigue distress (SMD -0.57, 95% CI -1.09 to -0.05) compared to usual care, and this could be considered clinically significant. Pooled data from four studies (439 participants) found a small reduction in fatigue interference with daily life (SMD -0.35, 95% CI -0.54 to -0.16; moderate quality evidence). No clear effects on fatigue were found related to type of cancer treatment or timing of intervention in relation to completion of cancer treatment, and there were insufficient data available to determine the effect of educational interventions on fatigue by stage of disease, tumour type or group versus individual intervention.Three studies (571 participants) provided low quality evidence for a reduction in anxiety in favour of the intervention group (mean difference (MD) -1.47, 95% CI -2.76 to -0.18) which, for some, would be considered clinically significant. Two additional studies not included in the meta-analysis also reported statistically significant improvements in anxiety in favour of the educational intervention, whereas a third study did not. Compared with usual care or attention control, educational interventions showed no significant reduction in depressive symptoms (four studies, 881 participants, SMD -0.12, 95% CI -0.47 to 0.23; very low quality evidence). Three additional trials not included in the meta-analysis found no between-group differences in the symptoms of depression. No between-group difference was evident in the capacity for activities of daily living or physical function when comparing educational interventions with usual care (4 studies, 773 participants, SMD 0.33, 95% CI -0.10 to 0.75) and the quality of evidence was low. Pooled evidence of low quality from two of three studies examining the effect of educational interventions compared to usual care found an improvement in global quality of life on a 0-100 scale (MD 11.47, 95% CI 1.29 to 21.65), which would be considered clinically significant for some.No adverse events were reported in any of the studies.Authors' conclusions: Educational interventions may have a small effect on reducing fatigue intensity, fatigue's interference with daily life, and general fatigue, and could have a moderate effect on reducing fatigue distress. Educational interventions focused on fatigue may also help reduce anxiety and improve global quality of life, but it is unclear what effect they might have on capacity for activities of daily living or depressive symptoms. Additional studies undertaken in the future are likely to impact on our confidence in the conclusions.The incorporation of education for the management of fatigue as part of routine care appears reasonable. However, given the complex nature of this symptom, educational interventions on their own are unlikely to optimally reduce fatigue or help people manage its impact, and should be considered in conjunction with other interventions. Just how educational interventions are best delivered, and their content and timing to maximise outcomes, are issues that require further research.US: http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD008144.pub2/abstractRecord #178 of 271ID: CD010856AU: Iheozor-Ejiofor ZipporahAU: Worthington Helen VAU: Walsh TanyaAU: O'Malley LucyAU: Clarkson Jan EAU: Macey RichardAU: Alam RahulAU: Tugwell PeterAU: Welch VivianAU: Glenny Anne-MarieTI: Water fluoridation for the prevention of dental cariesSO: Cochrane Database of Systematic ReviewsYR: 2015NO: 6PB: John Wiley & Sons, LtdKY: DMF Index;Dental Caries [prevention & control];Fluoridation [adverse effects] [methods];Fluorosis, Dental [epidemiology] [etiology];Observational Studies as Topic;Prospective Studies;Selection Bias;Adolescent[checkword];Child[checkword];Child, Preschool[checkword];Humans[checkword]DOI: 10.1002/14651858.CD010856.pub2AB: Background: Dental caries is a major public health problem in most industrialised countries, affecting 60% to 90% of school children. Community water fluoridation was initiated in the USA in 1945 and is currently practised in about 25 countries around the world; health authorities consider it to be a key strategy for preventing dental caries. Given the continued interest in this topic from health professionals, policy makers and the public, it is important to update and maintain a systematic review that reflects contemporary evidence.Objectives: To evaluate the effects of water fluoridation (artificial or natural) on the prevention of dental caries.To evaluate the effects of water fluoridation (artificial or natural) on dental fluorosis.Search methods: We searched the following electronic databases: The Cochrane Oral Health Group's Trials Register (to 19 February 2015); The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; Issue 1, 2015); MEDLINE via OVID (1946 to 19 February 2015); EMBASE via OVID (1980 to 19 February 2015); Proquest (to 19 February 2015); Web of Science Conference Proceedings (1990 to 19 February 2015); ZETOC Conference Proceedings (1993 to 19 February 2015). We searched the US National Institutes of Health Trials Registry (ClinicalTrials.gov) and the World Health Organization's WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform for ongoing trials. There were no restrictions on language of publication or publication status in the searches of the electronic databases.Selection criteria: For caries data, we included only prospective studies with a concurrent control that compared at least two populations - one receiving fluoridated water and the other non-fluoridated water - with outcome(s) evaluated at at least two points in time. For the assessment of fluorosis, we included any type of study design, with concurrent control, that compared populations exposed to different water fluoride concentrations. We included populations of all ages that received fluoridated water (naturally or artificially fluoridated) or non-fluoridated water.Data collection and analysis: We used an adaptation of the Cochrane 'Risk of bias' tool to assess risk of bias in the included studies.We included the following caries indices in the analyses: decayed, missing and filled teeth (dmft (deciduous dentition) and DMFT (permanent dentition)), and proportion caries free in both dentitions. For dmft and DMFT analyses we calculated the difference in mean change scores between the fluoridated and control groups. For the proportion caries free we calculated the difference in the proportion caries free between the fluoridated and control groups.For fluorosis data we calculated the log odds and presented them as probabilities for interpretation.Main results: A total of 155 studies met the inclusion criteria; 107 studies provided sufficient data for quantitative synthesis.The results from the caries severity data indicate that the initiation of water fluoridation results in reductions in dmft of 1.81 (95% CI 1.31 to 2.31; 9 studies at high risk of bias, 44,268 participants) and in DMFT of 1.16 (95% CI 0.72 to 1.61; 10 studies at high risk of bias, 78,764 participants). This translates to a 35% reduction in dmft and a 26% reduction in DMFT compared to the median control group mean values. There were also increases in the percentage of caries free children of 15% (95% CI 11% to 19%; 10 studies, 39,966 participants) in deciduous dentition and 14% (95% CI 5% to 23%; 8 studies, 53,538 participants) in permanent dentition. The majority of studies (71%) were conducted prior to 1975 and the widespread introduction of the use of fluoride toothpaste.There is insufficient information to determine whether initiation of a water fluoridation programme results in a change in disparities in caries across socioeconomic status (SES) levels.There is insufficient information to determine the effect of stopping water fluoridation programmes on caries levels.No studies that aimed to determine the effectiveness of water fluoridation for preventing caries in adults met the review's inclusion criteria.With regard to dental fluorosis, we estimated that for a fluoride level of 0.7 ppm the percentage of participants with fluorosis of aesthetic concern was approximately 12% (95% CI 8% to 17%; 40 studies, 59,630 participants). This increases to 40% (95% CI 35% to 44%) when considering fluorosis of any level (detected under highly controlled, clinical conditions; 90 studies, 180,530 participants). Over 97% of the studies were at high risk of bias and there was substantial between-study variation.Authors' conclusions: There is very little contemporary evidence, meeting the review's inclusion criteria, that has evaluated the effectiveness of water fluoridation for the prevention of caries.The available data come predominantly from studies conducted prior to 1975, and indicate that water fluoridation is effective at reducing caries levels in both deciduous and permanent dentition in children. Our confidence in the size of the effect estimates is limited by the observational nature of the study designs, the high risk of bias within the studies and, importantly, the applicability of the evidence to current lifestyles. The decision to implement a water fluoridation programme relies upon an understanding of the population's oral health behaviour (e.g. use of fluoride toothpaste), the availability and uptake of other caries prevention strategies, their diet and consumption of tap water and the movement/migration of the population. There is insufficient evidence to determine whether water fluoridation results in a change in disparities in caries levels across SES. We did not identify any evidence, meeting the review's inclusion criteria, to determine the effectiveness of water fluoridation for preventing caries in adults.There is insufficient information to determine the effect on caries levels of stopping water fluoridation programmes.There is a significant association between dental fluorosis (of aesthetic concern or all levels of dental fluorosis) and fluoride level. The evidence is limited due to high risk of bias within the studies and substantial between-study variation.US: http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD010856.pub2/abstractRecord #179 of 271ID: CD009374AU: Chen NingAU: Yang MiAU: Zhou MukeAU: Xiao JingAU: Guo JianAU: He LiTI: L-carnitine for cognitive enhancement in people without cognitive impairmentSO: Cochrane Database of Systematic ReviewsYR: 2017NO: 3PB: John Wiley & Sons, LtdDOI: 10.1002/14651858.CD009374.pub3AB: Background: Safe interventions to enhance cognitive function in cognitively healthy people would be very valuable for several reasons, including a better quality of life and professional success. While L-carnitine has been reported to enhance cognitive function in some conditions, its efficacy is disputed. The evidence of its efficacy for cognitively healthy people has not previously been systematically reviewed.Objectives: To assess the efficacy and safety of L-carnitine for the enhancement of cognitive function in people without cognitive impairment.Search methods: We searched ALOIS, the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group's Specialized Register, on 4 November 2016. We used the search terms 'L-carnitine' or 'acetyl-L-carnitine' or 'propionyl-L-carnitine' or 'ALC' or 'PLC' or 'ALCAR' or 'ALPAR'. We ran additional separate searches in several other sources to ensure that we retrieved the most up-to-date results. We also reviewed the bibliographies of the randomised controlled trials identified and contacted the authors and known experts in the field and pharmaceutical companies to identify additional published or unpublished data.Selection criteria: Eligible trials were randomised controlled trials (RCTs) or quasi-RCTs, parallel-group or cross-over, that compared L-carnitine or its derivatives, acetyl-L-carnitine or propionyl-L-carnitine, at any dose and for any length of treatment, with placebo or no treatment in cognitively healthy people of any age and either gender.Data collection and analysis: We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. Two review authors independently selected trials and evaluated the methodological quality, then extracted and analysed data from the included trials.Main results: Only two RCTs were eligible. One was a cross-over trial with 18 participants. The other randomised 400 participants to one of four treatments, of which two (L-carnitine and placebo) were relevant to this review, but the exact numbers of participants in these two treatment groups was not reported. All participants were young adults. Methodological details were poorly reported, and we considered the risk of bias in both studies to be unclear. The trials assessed different cognitive outcomes. We could extract cognitive data on approximately 200 participants from one trial. We found no evidence that L-carnitine has any effect on reaction time, vigilance, immediate memory, or delayed recall after three days of treatment. This trial report stated that there was a small number of adverse effects, none of which were serious. The small cross-over trial also reported no effect of L-carnitine on cognition, but did not provide data; no information was provided on adverse effects. We considered the available evidence to be of very low quality for all reported outcomes.Authors' conclusions: Due to the limited number of included trials, short-term treatment, and inadequate reporting, we were unable to draw any conclusions about the efficacy or safety of L-carnitine for cognitive enhancement in healthy adults. Well-designed, randomised, placebo-controlled trials of L-carnitine for cognition enhancement in cognitively healthy people, with large samples and relatively long-term follow-up, are still needed.US: http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD009374.pub3/abstractRecord #180 of 271ID: CD010697AU: Shah DheerajAU: Sachdev Harshpal SAU: Gera TarunAU: De-Regil Luz MariaAU: Peña-Rosas Juan PabloTI: Fortification of staple foods with zinc for improving zinc status and other health outcomes in the general populationSO: Cochrane Database of Systematic ReviewsYR: 2016NO: 6PB: John Wiley & Sons, LtdKY: Food, Fortified;Anemia [therapy];Edible Grain;Milk;Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic;Zinc [administration & dosage] [blood] [deficiency];Adolescent[checkword];Adult[checkword];Aged[checkword];Animals[checkword];Child[checkword];Child, Preschool[checkword];Female[checkword];Humans[checkword];Infant[checkword];Male[checkword];Middle Aged[checkword];Pregnancy[checkword]DOI: 10.1002/14651858.CD010697.pub2AB: Background: Zinc deficiency is a global nutritional problem, particularly in children and women residing in settings where diets are cereal based and monotonous. It has several negative health consequences. Fortification of staple foods with zinc may be an effective strategy for preventing zinc deficiency and improving zinc-related health outcomes.Objectives: To evaluate the beneficial and adverse effects of fortification of staple foods with zinc on health-related outcomes and biomarkers of zinc status in the general population.Search methods: We searched the following databases in April 2015: Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, Issue 3 of 12, 2015, the Cochrane Library), MEDLINE & MEDLINE In Process (OVID) (1950 to 8 April 2015), EMBASE (OVID) (1974 to 8 April 2015), CINAHL (1982 to April 2015), Web of Science (1900 to 9 April 2015), BIOSIS (1969 to 9 April 2015), POPLINE (1970 to April 2015), AGRICOLA, OpenGrey, BiblioMap, and Trials Register of Promoting Health Interventions (TRoPHI), besides regional databases (April 2015) and theses. We also searched clinical trial registries (17 March 2015) and contacted relevant organisations (May 2014) in order to identify ongoing and unpublished studies.Selection criteria: We included randomised controlled trials, randomised either at the level of the individual or cluster. We also included non-randomised trials at the level of the individual if there was a concurrent comparison group. We included non-randomised cluster trials and controlled before-after studies only if there were at least two intervention sites and two control sites. Interventions included fortification (central/industrial) of staple foods (cereal flours, edible fats, sugar, condiments, seasonings, milk and beverages) with zinc for a minimum period of two weeks. Participants were members of the general population who were over two years of age (including pregnant and lactating women) from any country.Data collection and analysis: Two review authors independently assessed the eligibility of studies for inclusion, extracted data from included studies, and assessed the risk of bias of the included studies.Main results: We included eight trials (709 participants); seven were from middle-income countries of Asia, Africa, Europe, and Latin America where zinc deficiency is likely to be a public health problem. Four trials compared the effect of zinc-fortified staple foods with unfortified foods (comparison 1), and four compared zinc-fortified staple foods in combination with other nutrients/factors with the same foods containing other nutrients or factors without zinc (comparison 2). The interventions lasted between one and nine months. We categorised most trials as having unclear or high risk of bias for randomisation, but low risk of bias for blinding and attrition. None of the studies in comparison 1 reported data on zinc deficiency.Foods fortified with zinc increased the serum or plasma zinc levels in comparison to foods without added zinc (mean difference (MD) 2.12 µmol/L, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.25 to 3.00 µmol/L; 3 studies; 158 participants; low-quality evidence). Participants consuming foods fortified with zinc versus participants consuming the same food without zinc had similar risk of underweight (average risk ratio 3.10, 95% CI 0.52 to 18.38; 2 studies; 397 participants; low-quality evidence) and stunting (risk ratio (RR) 0.88, 95% CI 0.36 to 2.13; 2 studies; 397 participants; low-quality evidence). A single trial of addition of zinc to iron in wheat flour did not find a reduction in proportion of zinc deficiency (RR 0.17, 95% CI 0.01 to 3.94; very low-quality evidence). We did not find a difference in serum or plasma zinc levels in participants consuming foods fortified with zinc plus other micronutrients when compared with participants consuming the same foods with micronutrients but no added zinc (MD 0.03 µmol/L, 95% CI -0.67 to 0.72 µmol/L; 4 studies; 250 participants; low-quality evidence). No trial in comparison 2 provided information about underweight or stunting.There was no reported adverse effect of fortification of foods with zinc on indicators of iron or copper status.Authors' conclusions: Fortification of foods with zinc may improve the serum zinc status of populations if zinc is the only micronutrient used for fortification. If zinc is added to food in combination with other micronutrients, it may make little or no difference to the serum zinc status. Effects of fortification of foods with zinc on other outcomes including zinc deficiency, children’s growth, cognition, work capacity of adults, or on haematological indicators are unknown. Given the small number of trials and participants in each trial, further investigation of these outcomes is required.US: http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD010697.pub2/abstractRecord #181 of 271ID: CD001366AU: Thompson Rachel LAU: Summerbell Carolyn DAU: Hooper LeeAU: Higgins Julian PTAU: Little PaulAU: Talbot DianeAU: Ebrahim ShahTI: Dietary advice given by a dietitian versus other health professional or self-help resources to reduce blood cholesterolSO: Cochrane Database of Systematic ReviewsYR: 2003NO: 3PB: John Wiley & Sons, LtdKY: Diet;Dietetics;Health Personnel;Patient Participation;Cholesterol [blood];Hypercholesterolemia [blood] [prevention & control];Nurses;Patient Education as Topic [methods];Physicians;Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic;Humans[checkword]CC: EPOCDOI: 10.1002/14651858.CD001366AB: Background: The average level of blood cholesterol is an important determinant of the risk of coronary heart disease. Blood cholesterol can be reduced by dietary means. Although dietitians are trained to provide dietary advice, for practical reasons it may be given by other health professionals or using self-help resources.Objectives: To assess the effects of dietary advice given by a dietitian compared with another health professional, or the use of self-help resources, in reducing blood cholesterol in adults.Search methods: We searched The Cochrane Library (to Issue 3 2002), the EPOC trial register (October 2002), MEDLINE (1966 to September 2002), EMBASE (1980 to September 2002), Cinahl (1982 to August 2002), Human Nutrition (1991 to 1998), Science Citation Index, Social Sciences Citation Index, hand searched conference proceedings on nutrition and heart disease, and contacted experts in the field.Selection criteria: Randomised trials of dietary advice given by a dietitian compared with another health professional or self-help resources. The main outcome was difference in blood cholesterol between dietitian groups compared with other intervention groups.Data collection and analysis: Two reviewers independently extracted data and assessed study quality.Main results: Twelve studies with 13 comparisons were included. Four studies compared dietitian with doctor, seven with self-help resources, and only one study was found for dietitian versus nurse and dietitian versus counsellor comparisons. Participants receiving advice from dietitians experienced a greater reduction in blood cholesterol than those receiving advice only from doctors (-0.25 mmol/L (95% CI -0.37, -0.12 mmol/L)). There was no statistically significant difference in change in blood cholesterol between dietitians and self-help resources (-0.10 mmol/L (95% CI -0.22, 0.03 mmol/L)). No statistically significant differences were detected for secondary outcome measures between any of the comparisons with the exception of dietitian versus nurse for HDLc, where the dietitian group showed a greater reduction (-0.06 mmol/L (95% CI -0.11, -0.01)) and dietitian versus counsellor for body weight, where the dietitian group showed a greater reduction (-5.80 kg (95% CI -8.91, -2.69 kg)).Authors' conclusions: Dietitians were better than doctors at lowering blood cholesterol in the short to medium term, but there was no evidence that they were better than self-help resources. There was no evidence that dietitians provided better outcomes than nurses.   The results should be interpreted with caution as the studies were not of good quality and the analysis was based on a limited number of trials.US: http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD001366/abstractRecord #182 of 271ID: CD007675AU: Wieland L.

Chronic diseases associated with overweight or obesity include diabetes, heart disease, hypertension and stroke.Objectives: To assess the effects of interactive computer-based interventions for weight loss or weight maintenance in overweight or obese people.Search methods: We searched several electronic databases, including CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, LILACS and PsycINFO, through 25 May 2011. We also searched clinical trials registries to identify studies. We scanned reference lists of included studies and relevant systematic reviews.Selection criteria: Studies were included if they were randomized controlled trials or quasi-randomized controlled trials that evaluated interactive computer-based weight loss or weight maintenance programs in adults with overweight or obesity. We excluded trials if the duration of the intervention was less than four weeks or the loss to follow-up was greater than 20% overall.Data collection and analysis: Two authors independently extracted study data and assessed risk of bias. Where interventions, control conditions, outcomes and time frames were similar between studies, we combined study data using meta-analysis.Main results: We included 14 weight loss studies with a total of 2537 participants, and four weight maintenance studies with a total of 1603 participants. Treatment duration was between four weeks and 30 months. At six months, computer-based interventions led to greater weight loss than minimal interventions (mean difference (MD) -1.5 kg; 95% confidence interval (CI) -2.1 to -0.9; two trials) but less weight loss than in-person treatment (MD 2.1 kg; 95% CI 0.8 to 3.4; one trial). At six months, computer-based interventions were superior to a minimal control intervention in limiting weight regain (MD -0.7 kg; 95% CI -1.2 to -0.2; two trials), but not superior to infrequent in-person treatment (MD 0.5 kg; 95% -0.5 to 1.6; two trials). We did not observe consistent differences in dietary or physical activity behaviors between intervention and control groups in either weight loss or weight maintenance trials. Three weight loss studies estimated the costs of computer-based interventions compared to usual care, however two of the studies were 11 and 28 years old, and recent advances in technology render these estimates unlikely to be applicable to current or future interventions, while the third study was conducted in active duty military personnel, and it is unclear whether the costs are relevant to other settings. One weight loss study reported the cost-effectiveness ratio for a weekly in-person weight loss intervention relative to a computer-based intervention as USD 7177 (EUR 5678) per life year gained (80% CI USD 3055 to USD 60,291 (EUR 2417 to EUR 47,702)). It is unclear whether this could be extrapolated to other studies. No data were identified on adverse events, morbidity, complications or health-related quality of life.Authors' conclusions: Compared to no intervention or minimal interventions (pamphlets, usual care), interactive computer-based interventions are an effective intervention for weight loss and weight maintenance. Compared to in-person interventions, interactive computer-based interventions result in smaller weight losses and lower levels of weight maintenance. The amount of additional weight loss, however, is relatively small and of brief duration, making the clinical significance of these differences unclear.US: http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD007675.pub2/abstractRecord #183 of 271ID: CD010680AU: Crawford FayAU: Welch KarenAU: Andras AlinaAU: Chappell Francesca MTI: Ankle brachial index for the diagnosis of lower limb peripheral arterial diseaseSO: Cochrane Database of Systematic ReviewsYR: 2016NO: 9PB: John Wiley & Sons, LtdDOI: 10.1002/14651858.CD010680.pub2AB: Background: Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) of the lower limb is common, with prevalence of both symptomatic and asymptomatic disease estimated at 13% in the over 50 age group. Symptomatic PAD affects about 5% of individuals in Western populations between the ages of 55 and 74 years. The most common initial symptom of PAD is muscle pain on exercise that is relieved by rest and is attributed to reduced lower limb blood flow due to atherosclerotic disease (intermittent claudication). The ankle brachial index (ABI) is widely used by a variety of healthcare professionals, including specialist nurses, physicians, surgeons and podiatrists working in primary and secondary care settings, to assess signs and symptoms of PAD. As the ABI test is non-invasive and inexpensive and is in widespread clinical use, a systematic review of its diagnostic accuracy in people presenting with leg pain suggestive of PAD is highly relevant to routine clinical practice.Objectives: To estimate the diagnostic accuracy of the ankle brachial index (ABI) - also known as the ankle brachial pressure index (ABPI) - for the diagnosis of peripheral arterial disease in people who experience leg pain on walking that is alleviated by rest.Search methods: We carried out searches of the following databases in August 2013: MEDLINE (Ovid SP),Embase (Ovid SP), the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL) (EBSCO), Latin American and Caribbean Health Sciences (LILACS) (Bireme), Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects and the Health Technology Assessment Database in The Cochrane Library, the Institute for Scientific Information (ISI) Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science, the British Library Zetoc Conference search and Medion.Selection criteria: We included cross-sectional studies of ABI in which duplex ultrasonography or angiography was used as the reference standard. We also included cross-sectional or diagnostic test accuracy (DTA) cohort studies consisting of both prospective and retrospective studies.Participants were adults presenting with leg pain on walking that was relieved by rest, who were tested in primary care settings or secondary care settings (hospital outpatients only) and who did not have signs or symptoms of critical limb ischaemia (rest pain, ischaemic ulcers or gangrene).The index test was ABI, also called the ankle brachial pressure index (ABPI) or the Ankle Arm Index (AAI), which was performed with a hand-held doppler or oscillometry device to detect ankle vessels. We included data collected via sphygmomanometers (both manual and aneroid) and digital equipment.Data collection and analysis: Two review authors independently replicated data extraction by using a standard form, which included an assessment of study quality, and resolved disagreements by discussion. Two review authors extracted participant-level data when available to populate 2×2 contingency tables (true positives, true negatives, false positives and false negatives).After a pilot phase involving two review authors working independently, we used the methodological quality assessment tool the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies-2 (QUADAS-2), which incorporated our review question - along with a flow diagram to aid reviewers' understanding of the conduct of the study when necessary and an assessment of risk of bias and applicability judgements.Main results: We screened 17,055 records identified through searches of databases. We obtained 746 full-text articles and assessed them for relevance. We scrutinised 49 studies to establish their eligibility for inclusion in the review and excluded 48, primarily because participants were not patients presenting solely with exertional leg pain, investigators used no reference standard or investigators used neither angiography nor duplex ultrasonography as the reference standard. We excluded most studies for more than one reason.Only one study met the eligibility criteria and provided limb-level accuracy data from just 85 participants (158 legs). This prospective study compared the manual doppler method of obtaining an ABI (performed by untrained personnel) with the automated oscillometric method. Limb-level data, as reported by the study, indicated that the accuracy of the ABI in detecting significant arterial disease on angiography is superior when stenosis is present in the femoropopliteal vessels, with sensitivity of 97% (95% confidence interval (CI) 93% to 99%) and specificity of 89% (95% CI 67% to 95%) for oscillometric ABI, and sensitivity of 95% (95% CI 89% to 97%) and specificity of 56% (95% CI 33% to 70%) for doppler ABI. The ABI threshold was not reported. Investigators attributed the lower specificity for doppler to the fact that a tibial or dorsalis pedis pulse could not be detected by doppler in 12 of 27 legs with normal vessels or non-significant lesions. The superiority of the oscillometric (automated) method for obtaining an ABI reading over the manual method with a doppler probe used by inexperienced operators may be a clinically important finding.Authors' conclusions: Evidence about the accuracy of the ankle brachial index for the diagnosis of PAD in people with leg pain on exercise that is alleviated by rest is sparse. The single study included in our review provided only limb-level data from a few participants. Well-designed cross-sectional studies are required to evaluate the accuracy of ABI in patients presenting with early symptoms of peripheral arterial disease in all healthcare settings. Another systematic review of existing studies assessing the use of ABI in alternative patient groups, including asymptomatic, high-risk patients, is required.US: http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD010680.pub2/abstractRecord #184 of 271ID: CD011396AU: O'Mahony MáirínAU: Comber HarryAU: Fitzgerald TonyAU: Corrigan Mark AAU: Fitzgerald EileenAU: Grunfeld Elizabeth AAU: Flynn Maura GAU: Hegarty JosephineTI: Interventions for raising breast cancer awareness in womenSO: Cochrane Database of Systematic ReviewsYR: 2017NO: 2PB: John Wiley & Sons, LtdDOI: 10.1002/14651858.CD011396.pub2AB: Background: Breast cancer continues to be the most commonly diagnosed cancer in women globally. Early detection, diagnosis and treatment of breast cancer are key to better outcomes. Since many women will discover a breast cancer symptom themselves, it is important that they are breast cancer aware i.e. have the knowledge, skills and confidence to detect breast changes and present promptly to a healthcare professional.Objectives: To assess the effectiveness of interventions for raising breast cancer awareness in women.Search methods: We searched the Cochrane Breast Cancer Group's Specialised Register (searched 25 January 2016), Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2015, Issue 12) in the Cochrane Library (searched 27 January 2016), MEDLINE OvidSP (2008 to 27 January 2016), Embase (Embase.com, 2008 to 27 January 2016), the World Health Organization’s International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) search portal and ClinicalTrials.gov (searched 27 Feburary 2016). We also searched the reference lists of identified articles and reviews and the grey literature for conference proceedings and published abstracts. No language restriction was applied.Selection criteria: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) focusing on interventions for raising women’s breast cancer awareness i.e. knowledge of potential breast cancer symptoms/changes and the confidence to look at and feel their breasts, using any means of delivery, i.e. one-to-one/group/mass media campaign(s).Data collection and analysis: Two authors selected studies, independently extracted data and assessed risk of bias. We reported the odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for dichotomous outcomes and mean difference (MD) and standard deviation (SD) for continuous outcomes. Since it was not possible to combine data from included studies due to their heterogeneity, we present a narrative synthesis. We assessed the quality of evidence using GRADE methods.Main results: We included two RCTs involving 997 women: one RCT (867 women) randomised women to receive either a written booklet and usual care (intervention group 1), a written booklet and usual care plus a verbal interaction with a radiographer or research psychologist (intervention group 2) or usual care (control group); and the second RCT (130 women) randomised women to either an educational programme (three sessions of 60 to 90 minutes) or no intervention (control group). Knowledge of breast cancer symptomsIn the first study, knowledge of non-lump symptoms increased in intervention group 1 compared to the control group at two years postintervention, but not significantly (OR 1.1, 95% CI 0.7 to 1.6; P = 0.66; 449 women; moderate-quality evidence). Similarly, at two years postintervention, knowledge of symptoms increased in the intervention group 2 compared to the control group but not significantly (OR 1.4, 95% CI 0.9 to 2.1; P = 0.11; 434 women; moderate-quality evidence). In the second study, women’s awareness of breast cancer symptoms had increased one month post intervention in the educational group (MD 3.45, SD 5.11; 65 women; low-quality evidence) compared to the control group (MD −0.68, SD 5.93; 65 women; P < 0.001), where there was a decrease in awareness. Knowledge of age-related riskIn the first study, women’s knowledge of age-related risk of breast cancer increased, but not significantly, in intervention group 1 compared to control at two years postintervention (OR 1.8; 95% CI 0.9 to 3.5; P < 0.08; 447 women; moderate-quality evidence). Women's knowledge of risk increased significantly in intervention group 2 compared to control at two years postintervention (OR 4.8, 95% CI 2.6 to 9.0; P < 0.001; 431 women; moderate-quality evidence). In the second study, women’s perceived susceptibility (how at risk they considered themselves) to breast cancer had increased significantly one month post intervention in the educational group (MD 1.31, SD 3.57; 65 women; low-quality evidence) compared to the control group (MD −0.55, SD 3.31; 65 women; P = 0.005), where a decrease in perceived susceptibility was noted. Frequency of Breast CheckingIn the first study, no significant change was noted for intervention group 1 compared to control at two years postintervention (OR 1.1, 95% CI 0.8 to 1.6; P = 0.54; 457 women; moderate-quality evidence). Monthly breast checking increased, but not significantly, in intervention group 2 compared to control at two years postintervention (OR 1.3, 95% CI 0.9 to 1.9; P = 0.14; 445 women; moderate-quality evidence). In the second study, women’s breast cancer preventive behaviours increased significantly one month post intervention in the educational group (MD 1.21, SD 2.54; 65 women; low-quality evidence) compared to the control group (MD 0.15, SD 2.94; 65 women; P < 0.045). Breast Cancer AwarenessWomen’s overall breast cancer awareness did not change in intervention group 1 compared to control at two years postintervention (OR 1.8, 95% CI 0.6 to 5.30; P = 0.32; 435 women; moderate-quality evidence) while overall awareness increased in the intervention group 2 compared to control at two years postintervention (OR 8.1, 95% CI 2.7 to 25.0; P < 0.001; 420 women; moderate-quality evidence). In the second study, there was a significant increase in scores on the Health Belief Model (that included the constructs of awareness and perceived susceptibility) at one month postintervention in the educational group (mean 1.21, SD 2.54; 65 women) compared to the control group (mean 0.15, SD 2.94; 65 women; P = 0.045).Neither study reported outcomes relating to motivation to check their breasts, confidence to seek help, time from breast symptom discovery to presentation to a healthcare professional, intentions to seek help, quality of life, adverse effects of the interventions, stages of breast cancer, survival estimates or breast cancer mortality rates.Authors' conclusions: Based on the results of two RCTs, a brief intervention has the potential to increase women’s breast cancer awareness. However, findings of this review should be interpreted with caution, as GRADE assessment identified moderate-quality evidence in only one of the two studies reviewed. In addition, the included trials were heterogeneous in terms of the interventions, population studied and outcomes measured. Therefore, current evidence cannot be generalised to the wider context. Further studies including larger samples, validated outcome measures and longitudinal approaches are warranted.US: http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD011396.pub2/abstractRecord #185 of 271ID: CD000227AU: Avenell AlisonAU: Mak Jenson CSAU: O'Connell DianneTI: Vitamin D and vitamin D analogues for preventing fractures in post-menopausal women and older menSO: Cochrane Database of Systematic ReviewsYR: 2014NO: 4PB: John Wiley & Sons, LtdKY: Bone Density Conservation Agents [therapeutic use];Calcitriol [therapeutic use];Dietary Supplements;Fractures, Spontaneous [etiology] [prevention & control];Frail Elderly;Hydroxycholecalciferols [therapeutic use];Osteoporosis [complications] [drug therapy];Osteoporosis, Postmenopausal [prevention & control];Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic;Vitamin D [analogs & derivatives] [therapeutic use];Vitamins [therapeutic use];Aged[checkword];Aged, 80 and over[checkword];Female[checkword];Humans[checkword];Male[checkword]DOI: 10.1002/14651858.CD000227.pub4AB: Background: Vitamin D and related compounds have been used to prevent osteoporotic fractures in older people. This is the third update of a Cochrane review first published in 1996.Objectives: To determine the effects of vitamin D or related compounds, with or without calcium, for preventing fractures in post-menopausal women and older men.Search methods: We searched the Cochrane Bone, Joint and Muscle Trauma Group Specialised Register (to December 2012), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (2012, Issue 12), MEDLINE (1966 to November Week 3 2012), EMBASE (1980 to 2012 Week 50), CINAHL (1982 to December 2012), BIOSIS (1985 to 3 January 2013), Current Controlled Trials (December 2012) and reference lists of articles.Selection criteria: Randomised or quasi-randomised trials that compared vitamin D or related compounds, alone or with calcium, against placebo, no intervention or calcium alone, and that reported fracture outcomes in older people. The primary outcome was hip fracture.Data collection and analysis: Two authors independently assessed trial risk of selection bias and aspects of methodological quality, and extracted data. Data were pooled, where possible, using the fixed-effect model, or the random-effects model when heterogeneity between studies appeared substantial.Main results: We included 53 trials with a total of 91,791 participants. Thirty-one trials, with sample sizes ranging from 70 to 36,282 participants, examined vitamin D (including 25-hydroxy vitamin D) with or without calcium in the prevention of fractures in community, nursing home or hospital inpatient populations. Twelve of these 31 trials had participants with a mean or median age of 80 years or over.Another group of 22 smaller trials examined calcitriol or alfacalcidol (1-alphahydroxyvitamin D3), mostly with participants who had established osteoporosis. These trials were carried out in the setting of institutional referral clinics or hospitals.In the assessment of risk of bias for random sequence generation, 21 trials (40%) were deemed to be at low risk, 28 trials (53%) at unclear risk and four trials at high risk (8%). For allocation concealment, 22 trials were at low risk (42%), 29 trials were at unclear risk (55%) and two trials were at high risk (4%).There is high quality evidence that vitamin D alone, in the formats and doses tested, is unlikely to be effective in preventing hip fracture (11 trials, 27,693 participants; risk ratio (RR) 1.12, 95% confidence intervals (CI) 0.98 to 1.29) or any new fracture (15 trials, 28,271 participants; RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.96 to 1.11).There is high quality evidence that vitamin D plus calcium results in a small reduction in hip fracture risk (nine trials, 49,853 participants; RR 0.84, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.74 to 0.96; P value 0.01). In low-risk populations (residents in the community: with an estimated eight hip fractures per 1000 per year), this equates to one fewer hip fracture per 1000 older adults per year (95% CI 0 to 2). In high risk populations (residents in institutions: with an estimated 54 hip fractures per 1000 per year), this equates to nine fewer hip fractures per 1000 older adults per year (95% CI 2 to 14). There is high quality evidence that vitamin D plus calcium is associated with a statistically significant reduction in incidence of new non-vertebral fractures. However, there is only moderate quality evidence of an absence of a statistically significant preventive effect on clinical vertebral fractures. There is high quality evidence that vitamin D plus calcium reduces the risk of any type of fracture (10 trials, 49,976 participants; RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.90 to 0.99).In terms of the results for adverse effects: mortality was not adversely affected by either vitamin D or vitamin D plus calcium supplementation (29 trials, 71,032 participants, RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.01). Hypercalcaemia, which was usually mild (2.6 to 2.8 mmol/L), was more common in people receiving vitamin D or an analogue, with or without calcium (21 trials, 17,124 participants, RR 2.28, 95% CI 1.57 to 3.31), especially for calcitriol (four trials, 988 participants, RR 4.41, 95% CI 2.14 to 9.09), than in people receiving placebo or control. There was also a small increased risk of gastrointestinal symptoms (15 trials, 47,761 participants, RR 1.04, 95% CI 1.00 to 1.08), especially for calcium plus vitamin D (four trials, 40,524 participants, RR 1.05, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.09), and a significant increase in renal disease (11 trials, 46,548 participants, RR 1.16, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.33). Other systematic reviews have found an increased association of myocardial infarction with supplemental calcium; and evidence of increased myocardial infarction and stroke, but decreased cancer, with supplemental calcium plus vitamin D, without an overall effect on mortality.Authors' conclusions: Vitamin D alone is unlikely to prevent fractures in the doses and formulations tested so far in older people. Supplements of vitamin D and calcium may prevent hip or any type of fracture. There was a small but significant increase in gastrointestinal symptoms and renal disease associated with vitamin D and calcium. This review found that there was no increased risk of death from taking calcium and vitamin D.US: http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD000227.pub4/abstractRecord #186 of 271ID: CD006896AU: Lassi Zohra SAU: Salam Rehana AAU: Haider Batool AAU: Bhutta Zulfiqar ATI: Folic acid supplementation during pregnancy for maternal health and pregnancy outcomesSO: Cochrane Database of Systematic ReviewsYR: 2013NO: 3PB: John Wiley & Sons, LtdKY: Maternal Welfare;Pregnancy Outcome;Anemia [blood] [prevention & control];Birth Weight;Folic Acid [administration & dosage];Hemoglobin A [analysis];Micronutrients [administration & dosage];Pregnancy Complications, Hematologic [blood] [prevention & control];Premature Birth [prevention & control];Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic;Stillbirth;Vitamin B Complex [administration & dosage];Female[checkword];Humans[checkword];Pregnancy[checkword]DOI: 10.1002/14651858.CD006896.pub2AB: Background: During pregnancy, fetal growth causes an increase in the total number of rapidly dividing cells, which leads to increased requirements for folate. Inadequate folate intake leads to a decrease in serum folate concentration, resulting in a decrease in erythrocyte folate concentration, a rise in homocysteine concentration, and megaloblastic changes in the bone marrow and other tissues with rapidly dividing cellsObjectives: To assess the effectiveness of oral folic acid supplementation alone or with other micronutrients versus no folic acid (placebo or same micronutrients but no folic acid) during pregnancy on haematological and biochemical parameters during pregnancy and on pregnancy outcomes.Search methods: We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (31 December 2012) and we contacted major organisations working in micronutrient supplementation, including UNICEF Nutrition Section, World Health Organization (WHO) Maternal and Reproductive Health, WHO Nutrition Division, and National Center on Birth defects and Developmnetal Disabilities, US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).Selection criteria: All randomised, cluster-randomised and cross-over controlled trials evaluating supplementation of folic acid alone or with other micronutrients versus no folic acid (placebo or same micronutrients but no folic acid) in pregnancy.Data collection and analysis: Two review authors independently assessed trials for inclusion, assessed risk of bias and extracted data. Data were checked for accuracy.Main results: Thirty-one trials involving 17,771 women are included in this review. This review found that folic acid supplementation has no impact on pregnancy outcomes such as preterm birth (risk ratio (RR) 1.01, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.73 to 1.38; three studies, 2959 participants), and stillbirths/neonatal deaths (RR 1.33, 95% CI 0.96 to 1.85; three studies, 3110 participants). However, improvements were seen in the mean birthweight (mean difference (MD) 135.75, 95% CI 47.85 to 223.68). On the other hand, the review found no impact on improving pre-delivery anaemia (average RR 0.62, 95% CI 0.35 to 1.10; eight studies, 4149 participants; random-effects), mean pre-delivery haemoglobin level (MD -0.03, 95% CI -0.25 to 0.19; 12 studies, 1806 participants), mean pre-delivery serum folate levels (standardised mean difference (SMD) 2.03, 95% CI 0.80 to 3.27; eight studies, 1250 participants; random-effects), and mean pre-delivery red cell folate levels (SMD 1.59, 95% CI -0.07 to 3.26; four studies, 427 participants; random-effects). However, a significant reduction was seen in the incidence of megaloblastic anaemia (RR 0.21, 95% CI 0.11 to 0.38, four studies, 3839 participants).Authors' conclusions: We found no conclusive evidence of benefit of folic acid supplementation during pregnancy on pregnancy outcomes.US: http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD006896.pub2/abstractRecord #187 of 271ID: CD005944AU: Oliveira Julicristie MAU: Allert RomanAU: East Christine ETI: Vitamin A supplementation for postpartum womenSO: Cochrane Database of Systematic ReviewsYR: 2016NO: 3PB: John Wiley & Sons, LtdKY: Postpartum Period;Infant Mortality;Maternal Mortality;Milk, Human [chemistry];Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic;Vitamin A [administration & dosage] [analysis];Vitamin A Deficiency [drug therapy];Vitamins [administration & dosage];Female[checkword];Humans[checkword];Infant[checkword];Infant, Newborn[checkword];Pregnancy[checkword]DOI: 10.1002/14651858.CD005944.pub3AB: Background: In areas where vitamin A deficiency (VAD) is a public health concern, the maternal dietary intake of vitamin A may be not sufficient to meet either the maternal nutritional requirements, or those of the breastfed infant, due the low retinol concentrations in breast milk.Objectives: To evaluate the effects of vitamin A supplementation for postpartum women on maternal and infant health.Search methods: We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (8 February 2016), LILACS (1982 to December 2015), Web of Science (1945 to December 2015), and the reference lists of retrieved studies.Selection criteria: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) or cluster-randomised trials that assessed the effects of vitamin A supplementation for postpartum women on maternal and infant health (morbidity, mortality and vitamin A nutritional status).Data collection and analysis: Two review authors independently assessed trials for inclusion, conducted data extraction, assessed risk of bias and checked for accuracy. We assessed the quality of the evidence using the GRADE approach.Main results: Fourteen trials of mainly low or unclear risk of bias, enrolling 25,758 women and infant pairs were included. The supplementation schemes included high, single or double doses of vitamin A (200,000 to 400,000 internation units (IU)), or 7.8 mg daily beta-carotene compared with placebo, no treatment, other (iron); or higher (400,000 IU) versus lower dose (200,000 IU). In all trials, a considerable proportion of infants were at least partially breastfed until six months. Supplement (vitamin A as retinyl, water-miscible or beta-carotene) 200,000 to 400,000 IU versus control (placebo or no treatment) Maternal: We did not find evidence that vitamin A supplementation reduced maternal mortality at 12 months (hazard ratio (HR) 1.01, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.44 to 2.21; 8577 participants; 1 RCT, moderate-quality evidence). Effects were less certain at six months (risk ratio (RR) 0.50, 95% CI 0.09 to 2.71; 564 participants; 1 RCT; low-quality evidence). The effect on maternal morbidity (diarrhoea, respiratory infections, fever) was uncertain because the quality of evidence was very low (50 participants, 1 RCT). We found insufficient evidence that vitamin A increases abdominal pain (RR 1.28, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.73; 786 participants; 1 RCT; low-quality evidence). We found low-quality evidence that vitamin A supplementation increased breast milk retinol concentrations by 0.20 µmol/L at three to three and a half months (mean difference (MD) 0.20 µmol/L, 95% CI 0.08 to 0.31; 837 participants; 6 RCTs). Infant: We did not find evidence that vitamin A supplementation reduced infant mortality at two to 12 months (RR 1.08, 95% CI 0.77 to 1.52; 6090 participants; 5 RCTs; low-quality evidence). Effects on morbidity (gastroenteritis at three months) was uncertain (RR 6.03, 95% CI 0.30 to 121.82; 84 participants; 1 RCT; very low-quality evidence). There was low-quality evidence for the effect on infant adverse outcomes (bulging fontanelle at 24 to 48 hours) (RR 2.00, 95% CI 0.61 to 6.55; 444 participants; 1 RCT). Supplement (vitamin A as retinyl) 400,000 IU versus 200,000 IUThree studies (1312 participants) were included in this comparison. None of the studies assessed maternal mortality, maternal morbidity or infant mortality. Findings from one study showed that there may be little or no difference in infant morbidity between the doses (diarrhoea, respiratory illnesses, and febrile illnesses) (312 participants, data not pooled). No firm conclusion could be drawn on the impact on maternal and infant adverse outcomes (limited data available).The effect on breast milk retinol was also uncertain due to the small amount of information available.Authors' conclusions: There was no evidence of benefit from different doses of vitamin A supplementation for postpartum women on maternal and infant mortality and morbidity, compared with other doses or placebo. Although maternal breast milk retinol concentrations improved with supplementation, this did not translate to health benefits for either women or infants. Few studies reported on maternal and infant mortality and morbidity. Future studies should include these important outcomes.US: http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD005944.pub3/abstractRecord #188 of 271ID: CD003243AU: Garg Sushil KAU: Gurusamy Kurinchi SelvanTI: Laparoscopic fundoplication surgery versus medical management for gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD) in adultsSO: Cochrane Database of Systematic ReviewsYR: 2015NO: 11PB: John Wiley & Sons, LtdKY: Fundoplication [adverse effects] [methods];Gastroesophageal Reflux [surgery] [therapy];Health Status;Heartburn [etiology];Laparoscopy;Proton Pump Inhibitors [therapeutic use];Quality of Life;Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic;Adult[checkword];Humans[checkword]CC: UPPERGIDOI: 10.1002/14651858.CD003243.pub3AB: Background: Gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD) is a common condition with 3% to 33% of people from different parts of the world suffering from GORD. There is considerable uncertainty about whether people with GORD should receive an operation or medical treatment for controlling the condition.Objectives: To assess the benefits and harms of laparoscopic fundoplication versus medical treatment for people with gastro-oesophageal reflux disease.Search methods: We searched the Cochrane Upper Gastrointestinal and Pancreatic Diseases Group (UGPD) Trials Register (June 2015), Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library Issue 6, 2015), Ovid MEDLINE (1966 to June 2015), and EMBASE (1980 to June 2015) to identify randomised controlled trials. We also searched the references of included trials to identify further trials.Selection criteria: We considered only randomised controlled trials (RCT) comparing laparoscopic fundoplication with medical treatment in people with GORD irrespective of language, blinding, or publication status for inclusion in the review.Data collection and analysis: Two review authors independently identified trials and independently extracted data. We calculated the risk ratio (RR) or standardised mean difference (SMD) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) using both fixed-effect and random-effects models with RevMan 5 based on available case analysis.Main results: Four studies met the inclusion criteria for the review, and provided information on one or more outcomes for the review. A total of 1160 participants in the four RCTs were either randomly assigned to laparoscopic fundoplication (589 participants) or medical treatment with proton pump inhibitors (571 participants). All the trials included participants who had had reflux symptoms for at least six months and had received long-term acid suppressive therapy. All the trials included only participants who could undergo surgery if randomised to the surgery arm. All of the trials were at high risk of bias. The overall quality of evidence was low or very low. None of the trials reported long-term health-related quality of life (HRQoL) or GORD-specific quality of life (QoL).The difference between laparoscopic fundoplication and medical treatment was imprecise for overall short-term HRQOL (SMD 0.14, 95% CI -0.02 to 0.30; participants = 605; studies = 3), medium-term HRQOL (SMD 0.03, 95% CI -0.19 to 0.24; participants = 323; studies = 2), medium-term GORD-specific QoL (SMD 0.28, 95% CI -0.27 to 0.84; participants = 994; studies = 3), proportion of people with adverse events (surgery: 7/43 (adjusted proportion = 14.0%); medical: 0/40 (0.0%); RR 13.98, 95% CI 0.82 to 237.07; participants = 83; studies = 1), long-term dysphagia (surgery: 27/118 (adjusted proportion = 22.9%); medical: 28/110 (25.5%); RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.57 to 1.42; participants = 228; studies = 1), and long-term reflux symptoms (surgery: 29/118 (adjusted proportion = 24.6%); medical: 41/115 (35.7%); RR 0.69, 95% CI 0.46 to 1.03; participants = 233; studies = 1).The short-term GORD-specific QoL was better in the laparoscopic fundoplication group than in the medical treatment group (SMD 0.58, 95% CI 0.46 to 0.70; participants = 1160; studies = 4).The proportion of people with serious adverse events (surgery: 60/331 (adjusted proportion = 18.1%); medical: 38/306 (12.4%); RR 1.46, 95% CI 1.01 to 2.11; participants = 637; studies = 2), short-term dysphagia (surgery: 44/331 (adjusted proportion = 12.9%); medical: 11/306 (3.6%); RR 3.58, 95% CI 1.91 to 6.71; participants = 637; studies = 2), and medium-term dysphagia (surgery: 29/288 (adjusted proportion = 10.2%); medical: 5/266 (1.9%); RR 5.36, 95% CI 2.1 to 13.64; participants = 554; studies = 1) was higher in the laparoscopic fundoplication group than in the medical treatment group.The proportion of people with heartburn at short term (surgery: 29/288 (adjusted proportion = 10.0%); medical: 59/266 (22.2%); RR 0.45, 95% CI 0.30 to 0.69; participants = 554; studies = 1), medium term (surgery: 12/288 (adjusted proportion = 4.2%); medical: 59/266 (22.2%); RR 0.19, 95% CI 0.10 to 0.34; participants = 554; studies = 1), long term (surgery: 46/111 (adjusted proportion = 41.2%); medical: 78/106 (73.6%); RR 0.56, 95% CI 0.44 to 0.72); participants = 217; studies = 1) and those with reflux symptoms at short-term (surgery: 6/288 (adjusted proportion = 2.0%); medical: 53/266 (19.9%); RR 0.10, 95% CI 0.05 to 0.24; participants = 554; studies = 1) and medium term (surgery: 6/288 (adjusted proportion = 2.1%); medical: 37/266 (13.9%); RR 0.15, 95% CI 0.06 to 0.35; participants = 554; studies = 1) was less in the laparoscopic fundoplication group than in the medical treatment group.Authors' conclusions: There is considerable uncertainty in the balance of benefits versus harms of laparoscopic fundoplication compared to long-term medical treatment with proton pump inhibitors. Further RCTs of laparoscopic fundoplication versus medical management in patients with GORD should be conducted with outcome-assessor blinding and should include all participants in the analysis. Such trials should include long-term patient-orientated outcomes such as treatment-related adverse events (including severity), quality of life, and also report on the social and economic impact of the adverse events and symptoms.US: http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD003243.pub3/abstractRecord #189 of 271ID: CD012292AU: von Philipsborn PeterAU: Stratil Jan MAU: Burns JacobAU: Busert Laura KAU: Pfadenhauer Lisa MAU: Polus StephanieAU: Holzapfel ChristinaAU: Hauner HansAU: Rehfuess EvaTI: Environmental interventions to reduce the consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages and their effects on healthSO: Cochrane Database of Systematic ReviewsYR: 2016NO: 7PB: John Wiley & Sons, LtdCC: PUBHLTHDOI: 10.1002/14651858.CD012292AB: This is the protocol for a review and there is no abstract.

Donor breast milk may retain some of the non-nutritive benefits of maternal breast milk for preterm or low birth weight infants. However, feeding with artificial formula may ensure more consistent delivery of optimal levels of nutrients. Uncertainty exists about the balance of risks and benefits of feeding formula versus donor breast milk for preterm or low birth weight infants.Objectives: To determine the effect of feeding with formula compared with donor breast milk on growth and development in preterm or low birth weight infants.Search methods: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL 2014, Issue 3), MEDLINE (1966 to March 2014), EMBASE (1980 to March 2014), CINAHL (1982 to March 2014), conference proceedings and previous reviews.Selection criteria: Randomised or quasi-randomised controlled trials comparing feeding with formula versus donor breast milk in preterm or low birth weight infants.Data collection and analysis: We extracted data using the standard methods of the Cochrane Neonatal Group, with separate evaluation of trial quality and data extraction by two review authors.Main results: Nine trials, in which 1070 infants participated, fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Four trials compared standard term formula versus donor breast milk and five compared nutrient-enriched preterm formula versus donor breast milk. Only the two most recent trials used nutrient-fortified donor breast milk. The trials contain various methodological quality weaknesses, specifically uncertainty about adequate allocation concealment methods in three trials and lack of blinding in most of the trials.Formula-fed infants had higher in hospital rates of increase in weight [mean difference (MD): 2.58 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.98 to 3.71) g/kg/day], length [MD 1.93 (95% CI 1.23 to 2.62) mm/week] and head circumference [MD 1.59 (95% CI 0.95 to 2.24) mm/week]. We did not find evidence of an effect on post-discharge growth rates or neurodevelopmental outcomes. Formula feeding increased the risk of necrotising enterocolitis: typical risk ratio 2.77 (95% CI 1.40 to 5.46); risk difference 0.04 (95% CI 0.02 to 0.07).Authors' conclusions: In preterm and low birth weight infants, feeding with formula compared with donor breast milk results in a higher rate of short-term growth but also a higher risk of developing necrotising enterocolitis. Limited data on the comparison of feeding with formula versus nutrient-fortified donor breast milk are available. This limits the applicability of the findings of this review as nutrient fortification of breast milk is now a common practice in neonatal care. Future trials may compare growth, development and adverse outcomes in infants who receive formula milk versus nutrient-fortified donor breast milk given as a supplement to maternal expressed breast milk or as a sole diet.US: http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD002971.pub3/abstractRecord #191 of 271ID: CD005303AU: Weir KellyAU: McMahon SandraAU: Chang Anne BTI: Restriction of oral intake of water for aspiration lung disease in childrenSO: Cochrane Database of Systematic ReviewsYR: 2012NO: 9PB: John Wiley & Sons, LtdKY: Drinking Water [administration & dosage];Pneumonia, Aspiration [prevention & control];Child[checkword];Child, Preschool[checkword];Humans[checkword];Infant[checkword]CC: AIRWAYSDOI: 10.1002/14651858.CD005303.pub3AB: Background: Primary aspiration of food and fluid is commonly seen in children with feeding and swallowing difficulties associated with a range of diseases and complex medical conditions. Respiratory sequelae and pneumonia are known to be associated with primary aspiration of ingested material, however causality between primary aspiration of specific food and fluid types and pulmonary effects in children is yet to be established in controlled trials. The relative pulmonary morbidity of aspiration of ingested food and fluid materials versus other causes of respiratory disease such as viral and bacterial causes, secondary aspiration of gastrointestinal contents and predisposing lung conditions such as chronic neonatal lung disease in a developing immune system is also unclear. Current management decisions for children who aspirate have to optimise oral nutrition and hydration, while reducing the risk of aspiration to preserve pulmonary integrity. This generally includes restricting aspirated food or fluids and providing texture-modified diets and thickened fluids. Young children frequently refuse thickened fluids providing a management dilemma for both families and health professionals.Objectives: Our objective was to evaluate the efficacy of restriction of oral water ingestion on the pulmonary status of children with thin fluid aspiration demonstrated on a modified barium swallow study.Search methods: The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), the Cochrane Airways Collaborative Review Group Specialised Register, MEDLINE, EMBASE and CINAHL databases were searched by the Cochrane Airways Group. The latest search was performed in May 2102.Selection criteria: All randomised controlled trials comparing restriction of oral intake of water with unlimited oral water ingestion were eligible to be included.Data collection and analysis: Results of searches were reviewed against a pre-determined criteria for inclusion. No eligible trials were identified for a paediatric population and thus no data were available for analysis. One trial in an adult population was identified and reported.Main results: No randomised controlled trials examining the efficacy of restriction of oral intake of water in the management of children with thin fluid aspiration were found. In a single study in an adult population with stroke, no significant differences were seen between a control group of oral water restriction and the experimental group of unlimited oral water ingestion on outcomes such as pneumonia, total oral fluid intake and dehydration.Authors' conclusions: There are no trials that have adequately evaluated the pulmonary effects of allowing or restricting oral water ingestion in children known to have primary aspiration of thin fluids. Thus, there is currently an absence of evidence to support a strict approach of full restriction of oral intake of water or support a more liberal approach of allowing oral water ingestion in children with primary aspiration of thin fluids.US: http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD005303.pub3/abstractRecord #192 of 271ID: CD004809AU: Priest NaomiAU: Armstrong RebeccaAU: Doyle JodieAU: Waters ElizabethTI: Policy interventions implemented through sporting organisations for promoting healthy behaviour changeSO: Cochrane Database of Systematic ReviewsYR: 2008NO: 3PB: John Wiley & Sons, LtdKY: Health Policy;Organizations;Sports;Alcohol Drinking [prevention & control];Diet;Feeding Behavior;Health Behavior;Health Promotion [methods];Prejudice;Safety;Smoking [prevention & control];Sunburn [prevention & control];Humans[checkword]DOI: 10.1002/14651858.CD004809.pub3AB: Background: Sporting organisations provide an important setting for health promotion strategies that involve policies, communication of healthy messages and creation of health promoting environments. The introduction of policy interventions within sporting organisations is one strategy to target high risk behaviours such as smoking, alcohol consumption, excess sun exposure, unhealthy eating and discrimination.Objectives: To update a review of all controlled studies evaluating policy interventions organised through sporting settings to increase healthy behaviour (related to smoking, alcohol, healthy eating, sun protection, discrimination, safety and access).Search methods: We updated the original (2004) searches in May 2007. We searched: the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, The Cochrane Library, Issue 2 2007); MEDLINE and MEDLINE In-Process and Other Non-Indexed Citations (2004 to Week 3 April 2007); EMBASE (2004 to Week 17 2007); PsyclNFO (2004 to April Week 1 2007); CINAHL (2004 to Week 1 May 2007); SPORTDiscus (2004 to April 2007); Sociological Abstracts (2004 to 2007); Dissertation Abstracts (2004 to May 2007), ERIC (2000 to 2007), freely available online health promotion and sports-related databases hosted by leading agencies, and the internet using sport and policy-related key words.Selection criteria: Controlled studies evaluating any policy intervention implemented through sporting organisations to instigate and/or sustain healthy behaviour change, intention to change behaviour, or changes in attitudes, knowledge or awareness of healthy behaviour, in people of all ages. Policies must address any of the following: smoking, alcohol, healthy eating, sun protection, access for disadvantaged groups, physical safety (not including injuries), and social and emotional health (e.g. anti-vilification, anti-discrimination).Uncontrolled studies which met the other inclusion criteria were to be reported in an annex to the review.Data collection and analysis: We assessed whether identified citations met the inclusion criteria. Abstracts were inspected independently by two review authors and full papers were obtained where necessary. As we located no controlled evaluation studies, we did not undertake data collection or analysis. We found no uncontrolled studies meeting other inclusion criteria, and therefore present no annex to the review.Main results: We found no rigorous studies evaluating the effectiveness of policy interventions organised through sporting organisations to increase healthy behaviours, attitudes, knowledge or the inclusion of health-oriented policies within the organisations.Authors' conclusions: We found no controlled studies to guide the use of policy interventions used in sporting settings. The original (2004) searches identified a number of case studies with anecdotal reporting of outcomes. We strongly recommend that rigorous evaluation techniques are employed more commonly in this field to illuminate the impact of health promoting policy on outcomes, and the contexts and processes which are likely to be effective in reducing harmful behaviours.US: http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD004809.pub3/abstractRecord #193 of 271ID: CD007845AU: Ooi Cheow PengAU: Yassin ZaitunAU: Hamid Tengku-AizanTI: Momordica charantia for type 2 diabetes mellitusSO: Cochrane Database of Systematic ReviewsYR: 2012NO: 8PB: John Wiley & Sons, LtdKY: Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2 [drug therapy];Glyburide [therapeutic use];Hypoglycemic Agents [therapeutic use];Metformin [therapeutic use];Momordica charantia [chemistry];Phytotherapy [methods];Plant Extracts [therapeutic use];Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic;Humans[checkword]CC: ENDOCDOI: 10.1002/14651858.CD007845.pub3AB: Background: Momordica charantia (bitter gourd) is not only a nutritious vegetable but it is also used in traditional medical practices to treat type 2 diabetes mellitus. Experimental studies with animals and humans suggested that the vegetable has a possible role in glycaemic control.Objectives: To assess the effects of mormodica charantia for type 2 diabetes mellitus.Search methods: Several electronic databases were searched, among these were The Cochrane Library (Issue 1, 2012), MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, SIGLE and LILACS (all up to February 2012), combined with handsearches. No language restriction was used.Selection criteria: We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared momordica charantia with placebo or a control intervention, with or without pharmacological or non-pharmacological interventions.Data collection and analysis: Two authors independently extracted data. Risk of bias of the trials was evaluated using the parameters of randomisation, allocation concealment, blinding, completeness of outcome data, selective reporting and other potential sources of bias. A meta-analysis was not performed given the quality of data and the variability of preparations of momordica charantia used in the interventions (no similar preparation was tested twice).Main results: Four randomised controlled trials with up to three months duration and investigating 479 participants met the inclusion criteria. Risk of bias of these trials (only two studies were published as a full peer-reviewed publication) was generally high. Two RCTs compared the effects of preparations from different parts of the momordica charantia plant with placebo on glycaemic control in type 2 diabetes mellitus. There was no statistically significant difference in the glycaemic control with momordica charantia preparations compared to placebo. When momordica charantia was compared to metformin or glibenclamide, there was also no significant change in reliable parameters of glycaemic control. No serious adverse effects were reported in any trial. No trial investigated death from any cause, morbidity, health-related quality of life or costs.Authors' conclusions: There is insufficient evidence on the effects of momordica charantia for type 2 diabetes mellitus. Further studies are therefore required to address the issues of standardization and the quality control of preparations. For medical nutritional therapy, further observational trials evaluating the effects of momordica charantia are needed before RCTs are established to guide any recommendations in clinical practice.US: http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD007845.pub3/abstractRecord #194 of 271ID: CD010156AU: Andrés MarianoAU: Sivera FranciscaAU: Falzon LouiseAU: Buchbinder RachelleAU: Carmona LoretoTI: Dietary supplements for chronic goutSO: Cochrane Database of Systematic ReviewsYR: 2014NO: 10PB: John Wiley & Sons, LtdKY: Dietary Supplements;Allopurinol [administration & dosage];Ascorbic Acid [administration & dosage];Chronic Disease;Gout [therapy];Lactose [administration & dosage];Milk;Peptides [administration & dosage];Powders;Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic;Adult[checkword];Animals[checkword];Humans[checkword]CC: MUSKELDOI: 10.1002/14651858.CD010156.pub2AB: Background: Dietary supplements are frequently used for the treatment of several medical conditions, both prescribed by physicians or self administered. However, evidence of benefit and safety of these supplements is usually limited or absent.Objectives: To assess the efficacy and safety of dietary supplementation for people with chronic gout.Search methods: We performed a search in the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE and CINAHL on 6 June 2013. We applied no date or language restrictions. In addition, we performed a handsearch of the abstracts from the 2010 to 2013 American College of Rheumatology (ACR) and European League against Rheumatism (EULAR) conferences, checked the references of all included studies and trial registries.Selection criteria: We considered all published randomised controlled trials (RCTs) or quasi-RCTs that compared dietary supplements with no supplements, placebo, another supplement or pharmacological agents for adults with chronic gout for inclusion. Dietary supplements included, but were not limited to, amino acids, antioxidants, essential minerals, polyunsaturated fatty acids, prebiotic agents, probiotic agents and vitamins. The main outcomes were reduction in frequency of gouty attacks and trial participant withdrawal due to adverse events. We also considered pain reduction, health-related quality of life, serum uric acid (sUA) normalisation, function (i.e. activity limitation), tophus regression and the rate of serious adverse events.Data collection and analysis: We used standard methodological procedures expected by The Cochrane Collaboration.Main results: We identified two RCTs (160 participants) that fulfilled our inclusion criteria. As these two trials evaluated different diet supplements (enriched skim milk powder (SMP) and vitamin C) with different outcomes (gout flare prevention for enriched SMP and sUA reduction for vitamin C), we reported the results separately.One trial including 120 participants, at moderate risk of bias, compared SMP enriched with glycomacropeptides (GMP) with unenriched SMP and with lactose over three months. Participants were predominantly men aged in their 50's who had severe gout. The frequency of acute gout attacks, measured as the number of flares per month, decreased in all three groups over the study period.The effects of enriched SMP (SMP/GMP/G600) compared with the combined control groups (SMP and lactose powder) at three months in terms of mean number of gout flares per month were uncertain (mean ± standard deviation (SD) flares per month: 0.49 ± 1.52 in SMP/GMP/G60 group versus 0.70 ± 1.28 in control groups; mean difference (MD) -0.21, 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.76 to 0.34; low-quality evidence). The number of withdrawals due to adverse effects was similar in both groups although again the results were imprecise (7/40 in SMP/GMP/G600 group versus 11/80 in control groups; risk ratio (RR) 1.27, 95% CI 0.53 to 3.03; low-quality evidence). The findings for adverse events were also uncertain (2/40 in SMP/GMP/G600 group versus 3/80 in control groups; RR 1.33, 95% CI 0.23 to 7.66; low-quality evidence). Gastrointestinal events were the most commonly reported adverse effects. Pain from self reported gout flares (measured on a 10-point Likert scale) improved slightly more in the SMP/GMP/G600 group compared with controls (mean ± SD reduction -1.97 ± 2.28 points in SMP/GMP/G600 group versus -0.94 ± 2.25 in control groups; MD -1.03, 95% CI -1.96 to -0.10; low-quality evidence). This was an absolute reduction of 10% (95% CI 20% to 1% reduction), which may not be of clinical relevance. Results were imprecise for the outcome improvement in physical function (mean ± SD Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ)-II (scale 0 to 3, 0 = no disability): 0.08 ± 0.23 in SMP/GMP/G60 group versus 0.11 ± 0.31 in control groups; MD -0.03, 95% CI -0.14 to 0.08; low-quality evidence). Similarly, results for sUA reduction were imprecise (mean ± SD reduction: -0.025 ± 0.067 mmol/L in SMP/GMP/G60 group versus -0.010 ± 0.069 in control groups; MD -0.01, 95% CI -0.04 to 0.01; low-quality evidence). The study did not report tophus regression and health-related quality of life impact.One trial including 40 participants, at moderate to high risk of bias, compared vitamin C alone with allopurinol and with allopurinol plus vitamin C in a three-arm trial. We only compared vitamin C with allopurinol in this review. Participants were predominantly middle-aged men, and their severity of gout was representative of gout in general. The effect of vitamin C on the rate of gout attacks was not assessed. Vitamin C did not lower sUA as much as allopurinol (-0.014 mmol/L in vitamin C group versus -0.118 mmol/L in allopurinol group; MD 0.10, 95% CI 0.06 to 0.15; low-quality evidence). The study did not assess tophus regression, pain reduction or disability or health-related quality of life impact. The study reported no adverse events and no participant withdrawal due to adverse events.Authors' conclusions: While dietary supplements may be widely used for gout, this review has shown a paucity of high-quality evidence assessing dietary supplementation.US: http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD010156.pub2/abstractRecord #195 of 271ID: CD006992AU: Vos Rimke CAU: van Avendonk Mariëlle JPAU: Jansen HannekeAU: Goudswaard Alexander NAU: van den Donk MaureenAU: Gorter KeesAU: Kerssen AnneloesAU: Rutten Guy EHMTI: Insulin monotherapy compared with the addition of oral glucose-lowering agents to insulin for people with type 2 diabetes already on insulin therapy and inadequate glycaemic controlSO: Cochrane Database of Systematic ReviewsYR: 2016NO: 9PB: John Wiley & Sons, LtdDOI: 10.1002/14651858.CD006992.pub2AB: Background: It is unclear whether people with type 2 diabetes mellitus on insulin monotherapy who do not achieve adequate glycaemic control should continue insulin as monotherapy or can benefit from adding oral glucose-lowering agents to the insulin therapy.Objectives: To assess the effects of insulin monotherapy compared with the addition of oral glucose-lowering agents to insulin monotherapy for people with type 2 diabetes already on insulin therapy and inadequate glycaemic control.Search methods: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, ClinicalTrials.gov, the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) and reference lists of articles. The date of the last search was November 2015 for all databases.Selection criteria: Randomised controlled clinical trials of at least two months' duration comparing insulin monotherapy with combinations of insulin with one or more oral glucose-lowering agent in people with type 2 diabetes.Data collection and analysis: Two review authors independently selected trials, assessed risk of bias, extracted data and evaluated overall quality of the evidence using GRADE. We summarised data statistically if they were available, sufficiently similar and of sufficient quality. We performed statistical analyses according to the statistical guidelines in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions.Main results: We included 37 trials with 40 treatment comparisons involving 3227 participants. The duration of the interventions ranged from 2 to 12 months for parallel trials and two to four months for cross-over trials.The majority of trials had an unclear risk of bias in several risk of bias domains. Fourteen trials showed a high risk of bias, mainly for performance and detection bias. Insulin monotherapy, including once-daily long-acting, once-daily intermediate-acting, twice-daily premixed insulin, and basal-bolus regimens (multiple injections), was compared to insulin in combination with sulphonylureas (17 comparisons: glibenclamide = 11, glipizide = 2, tolazamide = 2, gliclazide = 1, glimepiride = 1), metformin (11 comparisons), pioglitazone (four comparisons), alpha-glucosidase inhibitors (four comparisons: acarbose = 3, miglitol = 1), dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors (DPP-4 inhibitors) (three comparisons: vildagliptin = 1, sitagliptin = 1, saxagliptin = 1) and the combination of metformin and glimepiride (one comparison). No trials assessed all-cause mortality, diabetes-related morbidity or health-related quality of life. Only one trial assessed patients' treatment satisfaction and showed no substantial differences between the addition of either glimepiride or metformin and glimepiride to insulin compared with insulin monotherapy.Insulin-sulphonylurea combination therapy (CT) compared with insulin monotherapy (IM) showed a MD in glycosylated haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) of -1% (95% confidence interval (CI) -1.6 to -0.5); P < 0.01; 316 participants; 9 trials; low-quality evidence. Insulin-metformin CT compared with IM showed a MD in HbA1c of -0.9% (95% CI -1.2 to -0.5); P < 0.01; 698 participants; 9 trials; low-quality evidence. We could not pool the results of adding pioglitazone to insulin. Insulin combined with alpha-glucosidase inhibitors compared with IM showed a MD in HbA1c of -0.4% (95% CI -0.5 to -0.2); P < 0.01; 448 participants; 3 trials; low-quality evidence). Insulin combined with DPP-4 inhibitors compared with IM showed a MD in HbA1c of -0.4% (95% CI -0.5 to -0.4); P < 0.01; 265 participants; 2 trials; low quality evidence. In most trials the participants with CT needed less insulin, whereas insulin requirements increased or remained stable in participants with IM.We did not perform a meta-analysis for hypoglycaemic events because the included studies used different definitions.. In most trials the insulin-sulphonylurea combination resulted in a higher number of mild episodes of hypoglycaemia, compared to the IM group (range: 2.2 to 6.1 episodes per participant in CT versus 2.0 to 2.6 episodes per participant in IM; low-quality evidence). Pioglitazone CT also resulted in more mild to moderate hypoglycaemic episodes compared with IM (range 15 to 90 episodes versus 9 to 75 episodes, respectively; low-quality evidence. The trials that reported hypoglycaemic episodes in the other combinations found comparable numbers of mild to moderate hypoglycaemic events (low-quality evidence).The addition of sulphonylureas resulted in an additional weight gain of 0.4 kg to 1.9 kg versus -0.8 kg to 2.1 kg in the IM group (220 participants; 7 trials; low-quality evidence). Pioglitazone CT caused more weight gain compared to IM: MD 3.8 kg (95% CI 3.0 to 4.6); P < 0.01; 288 participants; 2 trials; low-quality evidence. Metformin CT was associated with weight loss: MD -2.1 kg (95% CI -3.2 to -1.1), P < 0.01; 615 participants; 7 trials; low-quality evidence). DPP-4 inhibitors CT showed weight gain of -0.7 to 1.3 kg versus 0.6 to 1.1 kg in the IM group (362 participants; 2 trials; low-quality evidence). Alpha-glucosidase CT compared to IM showed a MD of -0.5 kg (95% CI -1.2 to 0.3); P = 0.26; 241 participants; 2 trials; low-quality evidence.Users of metformin CT (range 7% to 67% versus 5% to 16%), and alpha-glucosidase inhibitors CT (14% to 75% versus 4% to 35%) experienced more gastro-intestinal adverse effects compared to participants on IM. Two trials reported a higher frequency of oedema with the use of pioglitazone CT (range: 16% to 18% versus 4% to 7% IM).Authors' conclusions: The addition of all oral glucose-lowering agents in people with type 2 diabetes and inadequate glycaemic control who are on insulin therapy has positive effects on glycaemic control and insulin requirements. The addition of sulphonylureas results in more hypoglycaemic events. Additional weight gain can only be avoided by adding metformin to insulin. Other well-known adverse effects of oral glucose-lowering agents have to be taken into account when prescribing oral glucose-lowering agents in addition to insulin therapy.US: http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD006992.pub2/abstractRecord #196 of 271ID: CD003808AU: Ricketts DavidAU: Lamont ThomasAU: Innes Nicola PTAU: Kidd EdwinaAU: Clarkson Jan ETI: Operative caries management in adults and childrenSO: Cochrane Database of Systematic ReviewsYR: 2013NO: 3PB: John Wiley & Sons, LtdKY: Dental Pulp;Dentin [surgery];Cariostatic Agents [therapeutic use];Dental Caries [therapy];Dental Enamel [surgery];Pit and Fissure Sealants [therapeutic use];Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic;Adult[checkword];Child[checkword];Humans[checkword]DOI: 10.1002/14651858.CD003808.pub3AB: Background: The management of dental caries has traditionally involved removal of all soft demineralised dentine before a filling is placed. However, the benefits of complete caries removal have been questioned because of concerns about the possible adverse effects of removing all soft dentine from the tooth. Three groups of studies have also challenged the doctrine of complete caries removal by sealing caries into teeth using three different techniques. The first technique removes caries in stages over two visits some months apart, allowing the dental pulp time to lay down reparative dentine (the stepwise excavation technique). The second removes part of the dentinal caries and seals the residual caries into the tooth permanently (partial caries removal) and the third technique removes no dentinal caries prior to sealing or restoring (no dentinal caries removal). This is an update of a Cochrane review first published in 2006.Objectives: To assess the effects of stepwise, partial or no dentinal caries removal compared with complete caries removal for the management of dentinal caries in previously unrestored primary and permanent teeth.Search methods: The following electronic databases were searched: the Cochrane Oral Health Group's Trials Register (to 12 December 2012), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library 2012, Issue 11), MEDLINE via OVID (1946 to 12 December 2012) and EMBASE via OVID (1980 to 12 December 2012). There were no restrictions regarding language or date of publication.Selection criteria: Parallel group and split-mouth randomised and quasi-randomised controlled trials comparing stepwise, partial or no dentinal caries removal with complete caries removal, in unrestored primary and permanent teeth were included.Data collection and analysis: Three review authors extracted data independently and in triplicate and assessed risk of bias. Trial authors were contacted where possible for information. We used standard methodological procedures exacted by The Cochrane Collaboration.Main results: In this updated review, four new trials were included bringing the total to eight trials with 934 participants and 1372 teeth. There were three comparisons: stepwise caries removal compared to complete one stage caries removal (four trials); partial caries removal compared to complete caries removal (three trials) and no dentinal caries removal compared to complete caries removal (two trials). (One three-arm trial compared complete caries removal to both stepwise and partial caries removal.) Four studies investigated primary teeth, three permanent teeth and one included both. All of the trials were assessed at high risk of bias, although the new trials showed evidence of attempts to minimise bias.Stepwise caries removal resulted in a 56% reduction in incidence of pulp exposure (risk ratio (RR) 0.44, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.33 to 0.60, P < 0.00001, I2 = 0%) compared to complete caries removal based on moderate quality evidence, with no heterogeneity. In these four studies, the mean incidence of pulp exposure was 34.7% in the complete caries removal group and 15.4% in the stepwise groups. There was also moderate quality evidence of no difference in the outcome of signs and symptoms of pulp disease (RR 0.78, 95% CI 0.39 to 1.58, P = 0.50, I2 = 0%).Partial caries removal reduced incidence of pulp exposure by 77% compared to complete caries removal (RR 0.23, 95% CI 0.08 to 0.69, P = 0.009, I2 = 0%), also based on moderate quality evidence with no evidence of heterogeneity. In these two studies the mean incidence of pulp exposure was 21.9% in the complete caries removal groups and 5% in the partial caries removal groups. There was insufficient evidence to determine whether or not there was a difference in signs and symptoms of pulp disease (RR 0.27, 95% CI 0.05 to 1.60, P = 0.15, I2 = 0%, low quality evidence), or restoration failure (one study showing no difference and another study showing no failures in either group, very low quality evidence).No dentinal caries removal was compared to complete caries removal in two very different studies. There was some moderate evidence of no difference between these techniques for the outcome of signs and symptoms of pulp disease and reduced risk of restoration failure favouring no dentinal caries removal, from one study, and no instances of pulp disease or restoration failure in either group from a second quasi-randomised study. Meta-analysis of these two studies was not performed due to substantial clinical differences between the studies.Authors' conclusions: Stepwise and partial excavation reduced the incidence of pulp exposure in symptomless, vital, carious primary as well as permanent teeth. Therefore these techniques show clinical advantage over complete caries removal in the management of dentinal caries. There was no evidence of a difference in signs or symptoms of pulpal disease between stepwise excavation, and complete caries removal, and insufficient evidence to determine whether or not there was a difference in signs and symptoms of pulp disease between partial caries removal and complete caries removal. When partial caries removal was carried out there was also insufficient evidence to determine whether or not there is a difference in risk of restoration failure. The no dentinal caries removal studies investigating permanent teeth had a similar result with no difference in restoration failure. The other no dentinal caries removal study, which investigated primary teeth, showed a statistically significant difference in restoration failure favouring the intervention.Due to the short term follow-up in most of the included studies and the high risk of bias, further high quality, long term clinical trials are still required to assess the most effective intervention. However, it should be noted that in studies of this nature, complete elimination of risk of bias may not necessarily be possible. Future research should also investigate patient centred outcomes.US: http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD003808.pub3/abstractRecord #197 of 271ID: CD011737AU: Hooper LeeAU: Martin NicoleAU: Abdelhamid AsmaaAU: Davey Smith GeorgeTI: Reduction in saturated fat intake for cardiovascular diseaseSO: Cochrane Database of Systematic ReviewsYR: 2015NO: 6PB: John Wiley & Sons, LtdKY: Cardiovascular Diseases [mortality] [prevention & control];Cause of Death;Dietary Carbohydrates [administration & dosage];Dietary Fats [administration & dosage];Dietary Fats, Unsaturated [administration & dosage];Dietary Proteins [administration & dosage];Energy Intake;Fatty Acids [administration & dosage];Myocardial Infarction [mortality] [prevention & control];Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic;Stroke [prevention & control];Adult[checkword];Humans[checkword]DOI: 10.1002/14651858.CD011737AB: Background: Reducing saturated fat reduces serum cholesterol, but effects on other intermediate outcomes may be less clear. Additionally it is unclear whether the energy from saturated fats that are lost in the diet are more helpfully replaced by polyunsaturated fats, monounsaturated fats, carbohydrate or protein. This review is part of a series split from and updating an overarching review.Objectives: To assess the effect of reducing saturated fat intake and replacing it with carbohydrate (CHO), polyunsaturated (PUFA) or monounsaturated fat (MUFA) and/or protein on mortality and cardiovascular morbidity, using all available randomised clinical trials.Search methods: We updated our searches of the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE (Ovid) and EMBASE (Ovid) on 5 March 2014. We also checked references of included studies and reviews.Selection criteria: Trials fulfilled the following criteria: 1) randomised with appropriate control group; 2) intention to reduce saturated fat intake OR intention to alter dietary fats and achieving a reduction in saturated fat; 3) not multifactorial; 4) adult humans with or without cardiovascular disease (but not acutely ill, pregnant or breastfeeding); 5) intervention at least 24 months; 6) mortality or cardiovascular morbidity data available.Data collection and analysis: Two review authors working independently extracted participant numbers experiencing health outcomes in each arm, and we performed random-effects meta-analyses, meta-regression, subgrouping, sensitivity analyses and funnel plots.Main results: We include 15 randomised controlled trials (RCTs) (17 comparisons, ˜59,000 participants), which used a variety of interventions from providing all food to advice on how to reduce saturated fat. The included long-term trials suggested that reducing dietary saturated fat reduced the risk of cardiovascular events by 17% (risk ratio (RR) 0.83; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.72 to 0.96, 13 comparisons, 53,300 participants of whom 8% had a cardiovascular event, I² 65%, GRADE moderate quality of evidence), but effects on all-cause mortality (RR 0.97; 95% CI 0.90 to 1.05; 12 trials, 55,858 participants) and cardiovascular mortality (RR 0.95; 95% CI 0.80 to 1.12, 12 trials, 53,421 participants) were less clear (both GRADE moderate quality of evidence). There was some evidence that reducing saturated fats reduced the risk of myocardial infarction (fatal and non-fatal, RR 0.90; 95% CI 0.80 to 1.01; 11 trials, 53,167 participants), but evidence for non-fatal myocardial infarction (RR 0.95; 95% CI 0.80 to 1.13; 9 trials, 52,834 participants) was unclear and there were no clear effects on stroke (any stroke, RR 1.00; 95% CI 0.89 to 1.12; 8 trials, 50,952 participants). These relationships did not alter with sensitivity analysis. Subgrouping suggested that the reduction in cardiovascular events was seen in studies that primarily replaced saturated fat calories with polyunsaturated fat, and no effects were seen in studies replacing saturated fat with carbohydrate or protein, but effects in studies replacing with monounsaturated fats were unclear (as we located only one small trial). Subgrouping and meta-regression suggested that the degree of reduction in cardiovascular events was related to the degree of reduction of serum total cholesterol, and there were suggestions of greater protection with greater saturated fat reduction or greater increase in polyunsaturated and monounsaturated fats. There was no evidence of harmful effects of reducing saturated fat intakes on cancer mortality, cancer diagnoses or blood pressure, while there was some evidence of improvements in weight and BMI.Authors' conclusions: The findings of this updated review are suggestive of a small but potentially important reduction in cardiovascular risk on reduction of saturated fat intake. Replacing the energy from saturated fat with polyunsaturated fat appears to be a useful strategy, and replacement with carbohydrate appears less useful, but effects of replacement with monounsaturated fat were unclear due to inclusion of only one small trial. This effect did not appear to alter by study duration, sex or baseline level of cardiovascular risk. Lifestyle advice to all those at risk of cardiovascular disease and to lower risk population groups should continue to include permanent reduction of dietary saturated fat and partial replacement by unsaturated fats. The ideal type of unsaturated fat is unclear.US: http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD011737/abstractRecord #198 of 271ID: CD005571AU: Lipp AllysonAU: Lusardi GailTI: Systemic antimicrobial prophylaxis for percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomySO: Cochrane Database of Systematic ReviewsYR: 2013NO: 11PB: John Wiley & Sons, LtdKY: Antibiotic Prophylaxis;Anti-Infective Agents [therapeutic use];Bacterial Infections [prevention & control];Gastrostomy [adverse effects] [methods];Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic;Risk Factors;Surgical Wound Infection [etiology] [prevention & control];Humans[checkword]CC: WOUNDSDOI: 10.1002/14651858.CD005571.pub3AB: Background: Percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) is a surgical procedure performed to maintain nutrition in the short- or long-term. During the procedure, a feeding tube that delivers either a liquid diet, or medication, via a clean or sterile delivery system, is placed surgically through the anterior abdominal wall. Those undergoing PEG tube placement are often vulnerable to infection because of age, compromised nutritional intake, immunosuppression, or underlying disease processes such as malignancy and diabetes mellitus. The increasing incidence of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) contributes both an additional risk to the placement procedure, and to the debate surrounding antibiotic prophylaxis for PEG tube placement. The aim of surgical antimicrobial prophylaxis is to establish a bactericidal concentration of an antimicrobial drug in the patient's serum and tissues, via a brief course of an appropriate agent, by the time of PEG tube placement in order to prevent any peristomal infections that might result from the procedure.Objectives: To establish whether prophylactic use of systemic antimicrobials reduces the risk of peristomal infection in people undergoing placement of percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tubes.Search methods: In August 2013, for this third update, we searched the Cochrane Wounds Group Specialised Register; The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library); Ovid Medline; Ovid Medline (In-Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations); Ovid Embase; and EBSCO CINAHL.Selection criteria: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating the use of prophylactic antimicrobials during PEG tube placement, with no restrictions regarding language of publication, date of publication, or publication status. Both review authors independently selected studies.Data collection and analysis: Both review authors independently extracted data and assessed study quality. Meta-analyses were performed where appropriate.Main results: One new trial was identified and included in this update, bringing the total to 13 eligible RCTs, with a total of 1637 patients. All trials reported peristomal infection as an outcome. A pooled analysis of 12 trials resulted in a statistically significant reduction in the incidence of peristomal infection with prophylactic antibiotics (1271 patients pooled: OR 0.36, 95% CI 0.26 to 0.50). The newly identified trial compared IV antibiotics with antibiotics via PEG and could not be included in the meta-analysis.Authors' conclusions: Administration of systemic prophylactic antibiotics for PEG tube placement reduces peristomal infection.US: http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD005571.pub3/abstractRecord #199 of 271ID: CD001142AU: Jewell DavidAU: Young GavinTI: Interventions for treating constipation in pregnancySO: Cochrane Database of Systematic ReviewsYR: 2001NO: 2PB: John Wiley & Sons, LtdKY: Dietary Fiber;Dietary Supplements;Constipation [therapy];Pregnancy Complications [therapy];Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic;Female[checkword];Humans[checkword];Pregnancy[checkword]CC: PREGDOI: 10.1002/14651858.CD001142AB: Background: Constipation is a common problem in late pregnancy. Circulating progesterone may be the cause of slower gastrointestinal movement in mid and late pregnancy.Objectives: The objective of this review was to assess the effects of different methods for treating constipation in pregnancy.Search methods: We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group trials register, the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register and MEDLINE. Date of last search: January 2001.Selection criteria: Randomised trials of any treatment for constipation in pregnancy.Data collection and analysis: Trial quality assessments and data extraction were done independently by two reviewers.Main results: Two suitable trials were identified. Fibre supplements increased the frequency of defecation (odds ratio 0.18, 95% confidence interval 0.05 to 0.67), and lead to softer stools. Stimulant laxatives are more effective than bulk-forming laxatives (odds ratio 0.30, 95% confidence interval 0.14 to 0.61), but may cause more side effects.Authors' conclusions: Dietary supplements of fibre in the form of bran or wheat fibre are likely to help women experiencing constipation in pregnancy.

Early detection of cancer through screening is effective in improving patient outcomes including death. However, people with SMI are less likely than others to take up available cancer screening.Objectives: To determine the effectiveness of interventions targeted at adults with SMI, or their carers or health professionals, and aimed at increasing the uptake of cancer screening tests for which the adults with SMI are eligible.Search methods: We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group’s Trials Register (October 25, 2012; December 19, 2014; April 07, 2015; July 04, 2016).Selection criteria: All randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of interventions, targeted towards adults with SMI or their carers or health professionals, to encourage uptake of cancer screening tests for which the adults with SMI were eligible.Data collection and analysis: Two review authors independently screened titles and abstracts and assessed these against the inclusion criteria.Main results: We did not find any trials that met the inclusion criteria.Authors' conclusions: A comprehensive search showed that currently there is no RCT evidence for any method of encouraging cancer screening uptake in people with SMI. No specific approach can therefore be recommended. High-quality, large-scale RCTs are needed urgently to help address the disparity between people with SMI and others in cancer screening uptake.US: http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD009641.pub3/abstract﻿Record #201 of 271ID: CD005060AU: Malanda Uriëll LAU: Welschen Laura MCAU: Riphagen Ingrid IAU: Dekker Jacqueline MAU: Nijpels GielAU: Bot Sandra DMTI: Self-monitoring of blood glucose in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus who are not using insulinSO: Cochrane Database of Systematic ReviewsYR: 2012NO: 1PB: John Wiley & Sons, LtdKY: Blood Glucose Self-Monitoring [methods];Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2 [blood] [urine];Hyperglycemia [prevention & control];Hypoglycemic Agents [administration & dosage];Insulin [administration & dosage];Quality of Life;Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic;Humans[checkword]CC: ENDOCDOI: 10.1002/14651858.CD005060.pub3AB: Background: Self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) has been found to be effective for patients with type 1 diabetes and for patients with type 2 diabetes using insulin. There is much debate on the effectiveness of SMBG as a tool in the self-management for patients with type 2 diabetes who are not using insulin.Objectives: To assess the effects of SMBG in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus who are not using insulin.Search methods: Multiple electronic bibliographic and ongoing trial databases were searched supplemented with handsearches of references of retrieved articles (date of last search: 07 July 2011).Selection criteria: Randomised controlled trials investigating the effects of SMBG compared with usual care, self-monitoring of urine glucose (SMUG) or both in patients with type 2 diabetes who where not using insulin. Studies that used glycosylated haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) as primary outcome were eligible for inclusion.Data collection and analysis: Two authors independently extracted data from included studies and evaluated the studies' risk of bias. Data from the studies were compared to decide whether they were sufficiently homogeneous to pool in a meta-analysis. Primary outcomes were HbA1c, health-related quality of life, well-being and patient satisfaction. Secondary outcomes were fasting plasma glucose level, hypoglycaemic episodes, morbidity, adverse effects and costs.Main results: Twelve randomised controlled trials were included and evaluated outcomes in 3259 randomised patients. Intervention duration ranged from 6 months (26 weeks) to 12 months (52 weeks). Nine trials compared SMBG with usual care without monitoring, one study compared SMBG with SMUG, one study was a three-armed trial comparing SMBG and SMUG with usual care and one study was a three-armed trial comparing less intensive SMBG and more intensive SMBG with a control group. Seven out of 11 studies had a low risk of bias for most indicators. Meta-analysis of studies including patients with a diabetes duration of one year or more showed a statistically significant SMBG induced decrease in HbA1c at up to six months follow-up (-0.3; 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.4 to -0.1; 2324 participants, nine trials), yet an overall statistically non-significant SMBG induced decrease was seen at 12 month follow-up (-0.1; 95% CI -0.3 to 0.04; 493 participants, two trials). Qualitative analysis of the effect of SMBG on well-being and quality of life showed no effect on patient satisfaction, general well-being or general health-related quality of life. Two trials reported costs of self-monitoring: One trial compared the costs of self-monitoring of blood glucose with self-monitoring of urine glucose based on nine measurements per week and with the prices in US dollars for self-monitoring in 1990. Authors concluded that total costs in the first year of self-monitoring of blood glucose, with the purchase of a reflectance meter were 12 times more expensive than self-monitoring of urine glucose ($481 or 361 EURO [11/2011 conversion] versus $40 or 30 EURO [11/2011 conversion]). Another trial reported a full economical evaluation of the costs and effects of self-monitoring. At the end of the trial, costs for the intervention were £89 (104 EURO [11/2011 conversion]) for standardized usual care (control group), £181 (212 EURO [11/2011 conversion]) for the less intensive self-monitoring group and £173 (203 EURO [11/2011 conversion]) for the more intensive self-monitoring group. Higher losses to follow-up in the more intensive self-monitoring group were responsible for the difference in costs, compared to the less intensive self-monitoring group.There were few data on the effects on other outcomes and these effects were not statistically significant. None of the studies reported data on morbidity.Authors' conclusions: From this review, we conclude that when diabetes duration is over one year, the overall effect of self-monitoring of blood glucose on glycaemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes who are not using insulin is small up to six months after initiation and subsides after 12 months. Furthermore, based on a best-evidence synthesis, there is no evidence that SMBG affects patient satisfaction, general well-being or general health-related quality of life. More research is needed to explore the psychological impact of SMBG and its impact on diabetes specific quality of life and well-being, as well as the impact of SMBG on hypoglycaemia and diabetic complications.US: http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD005060.pub3/abstractRecord #202 of 271ID: CD005039AU: Sguassero YaninaAU: de Onis MercedesAU: Bonotti Ana MaríaAU: Carroli GuillermoTI: Community-based supplementary feeding for promoting the growth of children under five years of age in low and middle income countriesSO: Cochrane Database of Systematic ReviewsYR: 2012NO: 6PB: John Wiley & Sons, LtdKY: Developing Countries;Dietary Supplements;Growth;Child Nutrition Disorders [diet therapy];Child Nutritional Physiological Phenomena;Infant Nutrition Disorders [diet therapy];Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic;Child, Preschool[checkword];Humans[checkword];Infant[checkword]DOI: 10.1002/14651858.CD005039.pub3AB: Background: Supplementary feeding is defined as the provision of extra food to children or families beyond the normal ration of their home diets. The impact of food supplementation on child growth merits careful evaluation in view of the reliance of many states and non-governmental organisations on this intervention to improve child health in low and middle income countries (LMIC). This is an update of a Cochrane review first published in 2005.Objectives: To evaluate the effectiveness of community-based supplementary feeding for promoting the physical growth of children under five years of age in LMIC.Search methods: For this updated review  we searched the following databases on 31 January 2011: CENTRAL (The Cochrane Library), MEDLINE (1948 to January week 3, 2011), EMBASE (1980 to week 3, 2011), CINAHL (1937 to 27 January 2011), LILACS (all years), WorldCat for dissertations and theses (all years) and ClinicalTrials.gov (all years).Selection criteria: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating supplementary feeding in comparison to a control group (no intervention or a placebo such as food with a very low number of nutrients and calories) in children from birth to five years of age in LMIC.Data collection and analysis: Two review authors independently extracted and analysed the data.Main results: We included eight RCTs (n = 1243 children) that were at relatively high risk of bias. We found high levels of clinical heterogeneity in the participants, interventions and outcome measures across studies. Nevertheless, in order to quantify pooled effects of supplementary feeding, we decided to combine studies according to prespecified characteristics. These were the children's age (younger or older than 24 months), their nutritional status at baseline (stunted or wasted, or not stunted or wasted) and the duration of the intervention (less or more than 12 months). A statistically significant difference of effect was only found for length during the intervention in children aged less than 12 months (two studies; 795 children; mean difference 0.19 cm; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.07 to 0.31). Based on the summary statistic calculated for each study, the mean difference (MD) between intervention and control groups ranged from 0.48 cm (95% CI 0.07 to 0.89) to 1.3 cm (95% CI 0.03 to 2.57) after 3 and 12 months of intervention, respectively. Data on potential adverse effects were lacking.Authors' conclusions: The scarcity of available studies and their heterogeneity makes it difficult to reach any firm conclusions. The review findings suggest supplementary feeding has a negligible impact on child growth; however, the pooled results should be interpreted with great caution because the studies included in the review are clinically diverse. Future studies should address issues of research design, including sample size calculation, to detect meaningful clinical effects and adequate intervention allocation concealment. In the meantime, families and children in need should be provided appropriate feeding, health care and sanitation without waiting for new RCTs to establish a research basis for feeding children. US: http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD005039.pub3/abstractRecord #203 of 271ID: CD008840AU: Walter John HAU: Jahnke NikkiAU: Remmington TraceyTI: Newborn screening for homocystinuriaSO: Cochrane Database of Systematic ReviewsYR: 2015NO: 10PB: John Wiley & Sons, LtdKY: Cystathionine beta-Synthase [deficiency];Early Diagnosis;Homocystinuria [diagnosis];Neonatal Screening;Humans[checkword];Infant, Newborn[checkword]CC: CFDOI: 10.1002/14651858.CD008840.pub4AB: Background: Homocystinuria is a rare inherited disorder due to a deficiency in cystathionine beta synthase. Individuals with this condition appear normal at birth but develop serious complications in childhood. Diagnosis and treatment started sufficiently early in life can effectively prevent or reduce the severity of these complications. This is an update of a previously published review.Objectives: To determine if newborn population screening for the diagnosis of homocystinuria due to cystathionine beta synthase deficiency leads to clinical benefit compared to later clinical diagnosis.Search methods: We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group's Inborn Errors of Metabolism Trials Register.Date of the most recent search of the Inborn Errors of Metabolism Register: 08 June 2015.Selection criteria: Randomised controlled trials and controlled clinical trials assessing the use of any neonatal screening test to diagnose infants with homocystinuria before the condition becomes clinically evident. Eligible studies compare a screened population versus a non-screened population.Data collection and analysis: No studies were identified for inclusion in the review.Main results: No studies were identified for inclusion in the review.Authors' conclusions: We were unable to identify eligible studies for inclusion in this review and hence it is not possible to draw any conclusions based on controlled studies; however, we are aware of uncontrolled case-series which support the efficacy of newborn screening for homocystinuria and its early treatment.

It is necessary, however, to assess the effects of these anti-diabetic agents on maternal and infant health outcomes. Additionally, women with previous gestational diabetes mellitus are increasingly found to be predisposed to impaired glucose tolerance and, despite the potential need for intervention for these women, there has been little evidence about the use of oral anti-diabetic agents by these women pre-conceptionally or during a subsequent pregnancy.Objectives: To investigate the effect of oral anti-diabetic agents in women with pre-existing diabetes mellitus, impaired glucose tolerance or previous gestational diabetes planning a pregnancy or pregnant women with diabetes mellitus on maternal and infant health.The use of oral antidiabetic agents for management of gestational diabetes in a current pregnancy is evaluated in a separate Cochrane review.Search methods: We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (March 2010).Selection criteria: We included randomised and quasi-randomised trials.Data collection and analysis: Two review authors independently assessed trial eligibility for inclusion.Main results: We identified 13 trials published as 25 papers using the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth group literature search, and an additional ongoing trial. We have not included any trials in the review. One trial is awaiting assessment and we have excluded twelve trials because they evaluated treatment of women with gestational diabetes or women with polycystic ovary syndrome, were not randomised controlled trials or data were not available.Authors' conclusions: Little randomised evidence is available evaluating the use of oral anti-diabetic agents in women with diabetes mellitus, impaired glucose tolerance, previous gestational diabetes mellitus planning a pregnancy or pregnant women with pre-existing diabetes mellitus. Large trials comparing any combination of oral anti-diabetic agent, insulin and dietary and lifestyle advice in these women, reporting on maternal and infant health outcomes, glycaemic control, women's views on the intervention and long-term health outcomes for mother and child, are required to guide clinical practice.US: http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD007724.pub2/abstractRecord #205 of 271ID: CD002117AU: Caldwell Patrina HYAU: Sureshkumar PremalaAU: Wong Wicky CFTI: Tricyclic and related drugs for nocturnal enuresis in childrenSO: Cochrane Database of Systematic ReviewsYR: 2016NO: 1PB: John Wiley & Sons, LtdKY: Antidepressive Agents, Tricyclic [adverse effects] [therapeutic use];Clinical Alarms;Enuresis [drug therapy];Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic;Child[checkword];Child, Preschool[checkword];Humans[checkword]DOI: 10.1002/14651858.CD002117.pub2AB: Background: Enuresis (bedwetting) affects up to 20% of five year-olds and 2% of adults. Although spontaneous remission often occurs, the social, emotional and psychological costs can be great. Tricyclics have been used to treat enuresis since the 1960s.Objectives: To assess the effects of tricyclic and related drugs compared with other interventions for treating children with enuresis.Search methods: We searched the Cochrane Incontinence Group Specialised Trials Register (containing trials identified from the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, MEDLINE in process, ClinicalTrials.gov, WHO ICTRP and handsearching of journals and conference proceedings), on 30 November 2015, and reference lists of relevant articles.Selection criteria: We included all randomised and quasi-randomised trials comparing a tricyclic or related drug with another intervention for treating enuresis. We also included combination therapies that included tricyclics. We excluded trials for treating daytime wetting.Data collection and analysis: Two review authors independently assessed the quality of the eligible trials, and extracted data. We settled differences by discussion with a third review author.Main results: Sixty-four trials met the inclusion criteria, involving 4071 children. The quality of many trials was poor, with comparisons addressed by single studies. Minor adverse effects were common, and reported in 30 trials. These included dizziness, headache, mood changes, gastrointestinal discomforts and neutropenia. More serious side-effects can occur but were not reported. Seven trials reported no adverse effects.Tricyclics are more effective than placebo, particularly for short-term outcomes. Compared to placebo, imipramine resulted in one fewer wet nights per week (mean difference (MD) -0.95, 95% confidence interval (CI) -1.40 to -0.50; 4 trials, 347 children), with fewer failing to achieve 14 consecutive dry nights (78% versus 95% for placebo, RR 0.74, 95% CI 0.61 to 0.90; 12 trials, 831 children). Amitriptyline and desipramine were more effective than placebo, but nortriptyline and mianserin showed no difference. Most tricyclics did not have a sustained effect after ceasing treatment, with 96% wetting at follow-up for imipramine versus 97% for placebo.Imipramine combined with oxybutynin is also more effective than placebo, with 33% failing to achieve 14 consecutive dry nights at the end of treatment versus 78% for placebo (RR 0.43, 95% CI 0.23 to 0.78; 1 trial, 47 children) and 45% wetting at follow-up versus 79% for placebo (RR 0.58, 95% CI 0.34 to 0.99; 1 trial, 36 children).There was insufficient evidence to judge the effect between different doses of tricyclics, and between different tricyclics. Treatment outcomes between tricyclic and desmopressin were similar, but were mixed when tricyclic was compared with an anticholinergic. However, when imipramine was compared with desmopressin plus oxybutynin (1 trial, 45 children), the combination therapy was more effective, with one fewer wet nights per week (MD 1.07, 95% CI 0.06 to 2.08) and 36% failing to achieve 14 consecutive dry nights versus 87% for imipramine (RR 2.39, 95% CI 1.35 to 4.25). Tricyclics were also more effective or showed no difference in response when compared to other drugs which are no longer used for enuresis.Tricyclics were less effective than alarms. Although there was no difference in the number of wet nights, 67% failed to achieve 14 consecutive dry nights for imipramine versus only 17% for alarms (RR 4.00, 95% CI 1.06 to 15.08; 1 trial, 24 children). Alarm therapy also had a more sustained effect after ceasing treatment with 100% on imipramine versus 58% on alarms wetting at follow-up (RR 1.67, 95% CI 1.03 to 2.69; 1 trial, 24 children).Imipramine was more effective than simple behavioural therapies during treatment, with one fewer wet nights per week compared with star chart plus placebo (MD -0.80, 95% CI -1.33 to -0.27; 1 trial, 250 children). At follow-up 40% were wet with imipramine versus 80% with fluids and avoiding punishment (RR 0.50, 95% CI 0.28 to 0.89; 1 trial, 40 children). However, imipramine was less effective than complex behavioural therapies, with 61% failing to achieve 14 consecutive dry nights for imipramine versus 33% for the three-step programme (RR 1.83, 95% CI 1.08 to 3.12; 1 trial, 72 children) and 16% for the three-step programme combined with motivational therapy and computer-led education (RR 3.91, 95% CI 2.30 to 6.66; 1 trial, 132 children) at the end of treatment, with similar results at follow-up.Tricyclics were more effective than restricted diet, with 99% failing to achieve 14 consecutive dry nights versus 84% for imipramine (RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.75 to 0.93; 1 trial, 147 children).There was insufficient evidence to judge the effect of tricyclics compared to the other miscellaneous interventions studied.At the end of treatment there were about two fewer wet nights for imipramine plus oxybutynin compared with imipramine monotherapy (MD -2.10, 95% CI -2.99 to -1.21; 1 trial, 63 children) and 48% on imipramine plus oxybutynin failed to achieve 14 consecutive dry nights compared with 74% on imipramine monotherapy (RR 0.68, 95% CI 0.50 to 0.92; 2 trials, 101 children). At follow-up, 45% on imipramine plus oxybutynin were wetting versus 83% on imipramine monotherapy (RR 0.55, 95% CI 0.32 to 0.92; 1 trial, 36 children).When imipramine combined with desmopressin was compared with imipramine monotherapy, there was no difference in outcomes. However, when imipramine plus desmopressin was compared with desmopressin monotherapy, the combination was more effective, with 15% not achieving 14 consecutive dry nights at the end of treatment for imipramine plus desmopressin versus 40% for desmopressin monotherapy (RR 0.38, 95% CI 0.17 to 0.83; 1 trial, 86 children). Tricyclics combined with alarm therapy were not more effective than alarm monotherapy, alarm combined with desmopressin or alarm combined with nortriptyline. The addition of a tricyclic to other behavioural therapies did not alter treatment response.Authors' conclusions: There was evidence that tricyclics are effective at reducing the number of wet nights during treatment, but do not have a sustained effect after treatment stops, with most children relapsing. In contrast, there was evidence that alarm therapy has better short- and long-term outcomes. There was some evidence that tricyclics combined with anticholinergics may be more effective that tricyclic monotherapy.US: http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD002117.pub2/abstractRecord #206 of 271ID: CD001198AU: Morton AlisonAU: Wolfe SusanTI: Enteral tube feeding for cystic fibrosisSO: Cochrane Database of Systematic ReviewsYR: 2015NO: 4PB: John Wiley & Sons, LtdKY: Dietary Supplements;Enteral Nutrition;Nutritional Status;Cystic Fibrosis [therapy];Quality of Life;Humans[checkword]CC: CFDOI: 10.1002/14651858.CD001198.pub4AB: Background: Enteral tube feeding is routinely used in many cystic fibrosis centres when oral dietary and supplement intake has failed to achieve an adequate nutritional status. The use of this method of feeding is assessed on an individual basis taking into consideration the patients age and clinical status.Objectives: To examine the evidence that in people with cystic fibrosis, supplemental enteral tube feeding improves nutritional status, respiratory function, and quality of life without significant adverse effects.Search methods: We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group Trials Register which comprises references identified from comprehensive electronic database searches and handsearches of relevant journals and abstract books of conference proceedings. We also contacted the companies that market enteral feeds and reviewed their databases.Date of the most recent search of the Group's Cystic Fibrosis Trials Register: 13 February 2015.Date of the most recent hand search of PubMed and conference abstract books: 13 February 2015.Selection criteria: All randomised controlled trials comparing supplemental enteral tube feeding for one month or longer with no specific intervention in people with cystic fibrosis.Data collection and analysis: The searches identified 38 trials; however, none were eligible for inclusion in this review.Main results: There are no trials included in this review.Authors' conclusions: Supplemental enteral tube feeding is widely used throughout the world to improve nutritional status in people with cystic fibrosis. The methods mostly used, nasogastric or gastrostomy feeding, are expensive and may have a negative effect on self-esteem and body image. Reported use of enteral tube feeding suggests that it results in nutritional and respiratory improvement; but, efficacy has not been fully assessed by randomised controlled trials. It is acknowledged, however, that performing a randomised controlled trial would be difficult due to the ethics of withholding an intervention in a group of patients whose nutritional status necessitates it.US: http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD001198.pub4/abstractRecord #207 of 271ID: CD008951AU: Radner HelgaAU: Ramiro SofiaAU: Buchbinder RachelleAU: Landewé Robert BMAU: van der Heijde DésiréeAU: Aletaha DanielTI: Pain management for inflammatory arthritis (rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis and other spondyloarthritis) and gastrointestinal or liver comorbiditySO: Cochrane Database of Systematic ReviewsYR: 2012NO: 1PB: John Wiley & Sons, LtdKY: Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal [adverse effects] [therapeutic use];Arthritis [complications] [drug therapy];Gastrointestinal Diseases [complications] [therapy];Liver Diseases [complications] [therapy];Naproxen [adverse effects] [therapeutic use];Pain [drug therapy];Pain Management [methods];Female[checkword];Humans[checkword];Male[checkword];Middle Aged[checkword]CC: MUSKELDOI: 10.1002/14651858.CD008951.pub2AB: Background: Even with optimal disease-modifying treatment and good control of disease activity, persistent pain due to structural damage is common in people with inflammatory arthritis and therefore additional treatment for pain might be required. Because comorbidity is highly prevalent in people with inflammatory arthritis, it is important to consider comorbidities such as gastrointestinal or liver diseases in deciding upon optimal pharmacologic pain therapy.Objectives: To assess the efficacy and safety of pharmacological pain treatment in patients with inflammatory arthritis who have gastrointestinal or liver comorbidities, or both.Search methods: We searched Cochrane CENTRAL, MEDLINE and EMBASE for studies, to June 2010. We also searched the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) and the European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) conference abstracts (2007 to 2010) and performed a handsearch of reference lists of articles.Selection criteria: All randomised or quasi-randomised controlled trials (RCTs or CCTs) were considered for inclusion, for the assessment of efficacy. For safety, we also considered single arm trials, controlled before-after studies, interrupted time series, cohort and case-control studies, and case series of 10 or more consecutive cases. Pain therapy comprised paracetamol, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), opioids, opioid-like drugs (tramadol) and neuromodulators (antidepressants, anticonvulsants and muscle relaxants). The study population comprised adults (≥ 18 years) with rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis or other spondyloarthritis who had gastrointestinal or hepatic, or both, comorbid conditions. Outcomes of interest were pain, adverse effects, function and quality of life. Studies that included a mixed population of inflammatory arthritis and other conditions were included only if results for inflammatory arthritis were reported separately.Data collection and analysis: Two review authors independently selected trials for inclusion, assessed risk of bias and extracted data.Main results: From 2869 identified articles only one single arm open trial fulfilled our inclusion criteria. This trial assessed the safety and efficacy of naproxen (dosage not specified) in 58 patients with active rheumatoid arthritis and gastrointestinal comorbidities for up to 52 weeks. Thirteen participants (22%) remained on gold therapy, four participants (10%) remained on hydroxychloroquine, 27 (47%) remained on corticosteroids, 12 (21%) remained on salicylates and all participants continued on antacids and a bland diet. The presence of faecal occult blood was reported in 1/58 participants tested between weeks 1 to 26 and 2/32 participants tested between weeks 27 to 52. Over the course of the study, seven participants (12.1%) withdrew due to adverse events but, of these, only two participants withdrew due to gastrointestinal side effects (abdominal pain n = 1, nausea n = 1) and no serious adverse events were reported. It was noteable that out of 14 studies excluded due to inclusion of a mixed population (osteoarthritis or other rheumatic conditions) or an intervention that was already withdrawn, five trials reported a higher risk of developing gastrointestinal events in patients with prior gastrointestinal events when treated with NSAIDs.Authors' conclusions: On the basis of the current review, there is scant evidence to guide clinicians about how gastrointestinal or liver comorbidities should influence the choice of pain treatment in patients with rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis or other spondyloarthritis. Based upon additional studies that included a mixed population of participants with a range of rheumatic conditions, NSAIDs should be used cautiously in patients with inflammatory arthritis and a history of gastrointestinaI comorbidity as there is consistent evidence that they may be at increased risk.US: http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD008951.pub2/abstractRecord #208 of 271ID: CD000148AU: Say LaleAU: Gülmezoglu A MetinAU: Hofmeyr G JustusTI: Maternal nutrient supplementation for suspected impaired fetal growthSO: Cochrane Database of Systematic ReviewsYR: 2003NO: 1PB: John Wiley & Sons, LtdKY: Dietary Supplements;Nutritional Support;Fetal Growth Retardation [prevention & control];Female[checkword];Humans[checkword];Pregnancy[checkword]CC: PREGDOI: 10.1002/14651858.CD000148AB: Background: One way of attempting to improve fetal growth has been nutrient supplementation for the mother when fetal growth is impaired. Different nutrients such as carbohydrates and amino acids have been suggested as treatments for impaired fetal growth.Objectives: The objective of this review was to assess the effects of nutrient administration for suspected fetal growth impairment on fetal growth and perinatal outcome.Search methods: We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (March 2010).Selection criteria: Acceptably controlled trials of nutrient administration for suspected impaired fetal growth compared to placebo or no treatment.Data collection and analysis: We assessed trial quality.Main results: Four studies, involving 165 women, were included. The trials were small or had methodological limitations, or both. Carnite was associated with shorter pregnancy duration after enrolment (mean difference -2.12, 95% confidence interval -3.58 to -0.66 weeks). Intraamniotic administration of nutrients was related to higher birthweight (2575 g, standard deviation (SD) 780) as compared to intravenous administration (2080 g SD 457). No other differences were found.Authors' conclusions: There is not enough evidence to evaluate the use of nutrient therapy for suspected impaired fetal growth. The studies were too small to assess clinical outcomes adequately.US: http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD000148/abstractRecord #209 of 271ID: CD001890AU: Roderick Paul JAU: Willis Narelle SAU: Blakeley SaraAU: Jones ChrisAU: Tomson CharlesTI: Correction of chronic metabolic acidosis for chronic kidney disease patientsSO: Cochrane Database of Systematic ReviewsYR: 2007NO: 1PB: John Wiley & Sons, LtdKY: Renal Dialysis;Acidosis [therapy];Chronic Disease;Hemodialysis Solutions [therapeutic use];Kidney Diseases [complications] [metabolism];Sodium Bicarbonate [therapeutic use];Humans[checkword]CC: RENALDOI: 10.1002/14651858.CD001890.pub3AB: Background: Metabolic acidosis is a feature of chronic kidney disease (CKD) due to the reduced capacity of the kidney to synthesise ammonia and excrete hydrogen ions. It has adverse consequences on protein and muscle metabolism, bone turnover and the development of renal osteodystrophy. Metabolic acidosis may be corrected by oral bicarbonate supplementation or in dialysis patients by increasing the bicarbonate concentration in dialysate fluid.Objectives: To examine the benefits and harms of treating metabolic acidosis in patients with CKD, both prior to reaching end-stage renal disease (ESRD) or whilst on renal replacement therapy (RRT), with sodium bicarbonate or increasing the bicarbonate concentration of dialysate.Search methods: We searched the Cochrane Renal Group's Specialised Register [up to 4 March 2013] through contact with the Trials' Search Co-ordinator using search terms relevant to this review.Selection criteria: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs), crossover RCTs and quasi-RCTs investigating the correction of chronic metabolic acidosis in adults or children with CKD.Data collection and analysis: Outcomes were analysed using risk ratio (RR) and mean difference (MD) for continuous measures.Main results: We identified three trials in adult dialysis patients (n = 117). There were insufficient data for most outcomes for meta-analysis. In all three trials acidosis improved in the intervention group though there was variation in achieved bicarbonate level. There was no evidence of effect on blood pressure or sodium levels. Some measures of nutritional status/protein metabolism (e.g. SGA, NP NA) were significantly improved by correction in the one trial that looked in these in detail. There was heterogeneity of the effect on serum albumin in two trials. Serum PTH fell significantly in the two trials that estimated this, with no significant effect on calcium or phosphate though both fell after correction. Complex bone markers were assessed in one study, with some evidence for a reduction in bone turnover in those with initial high bone turnover and an increase in low turnover patients. The studies were underpowered to assess clinical outcomes, in the one study that did there was some evidence for a reduction in hospitalisation after correction.Authors' conclusions: The evidence for the benefits and risks of correcting metabolic acidosis is very limited with no RCTs in pre-ESRD patients, none in children, and only three small trials in dialysis patients. These trials suggest there may be some beneficial effects on both protein and bone metabolism but the trials were underpowered to provide robust evidence.US: http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD001890.pub3/abstractRecord #210 of 271ID: CD004536AU: Grobler LieslAU: Siegfried NandiAU: Visser Marianne EAU: Mahlungulu Sarah SNAU: Volmink JimmyTI: Nutritional interventions for reducing morbidity and mortality in people with HIVSO: Cochrane Database of Systematic ReviewsYR: 2013NO: 2PB: John Wiley & Sons, LtdKY: Diet [standards];Dietary Carbohydrates [administration & dosage];Dietary Fats [administration & dosage];Disease Progression;Energy Intake;HIV Infections [complications] [diet therapy] [mortality];Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic;Adult[checkword];Child[checkword];Humans[checkword]CC: HIVDOI: 10.1002/14651858.CD004536.pub3AB: Background: Adequate nutrition is important for optimal immune and metabolic function. Dietary support may, therefore, improve clinical outcomes in HIV-infected individuals by reducing the incidence of HIV-associated complications and attenuating progression of HIV disease, improving quality of life and ultimately reducing disease-related mortality.Objectives: To evaluate the effectiveness of various macronutrient interventions, given orally, in reducing morbidity and mortality in adults and children living with HIV infection.Search methods: We searched CENTRAL (up to August 2011), MEDLINE (1966 to August 2011), EMBASE (1988 to August 2011), LILACS (up to February 2012), and Gateway (March 2006-February 2010). We also scanned reference lists of articles and contacted authors of relevant studies and other researchers.Selection criteria: Randomised controlled trials evaluating the effectiveness of macronutrient interventions compared with no nutritional supplements or placebo in the management of adults and children infected with HIV.Data collection and analysis: Three reviewers independently applied study selection criteria, assessed study quality, and extracted data. Effects were assessed using mean difference and 95% confidence intervals. Homogenous studies were combined wherever it was clinically meaningful to do so and a meta-analysis using the random effects model was conducted.Main results: Fourteen trials (including 1725 HIV positive adults and 271 HIV positive children), were included in this review. Neither supplementary food nor daily supplement of Spirulina significantly altered the risk of death compared with no supplement or placebo in malnourished, ART naive adult participants in the two studies which reported on this outcome. A nutritional supplement enhanced with protein did not significantly alter the risk of death compared to standard nutritional care in children with prolonged diarrhoea. Supplementation with macronutrient formulas given to provide protein and/or energy and fortified with micronutrients, in conjunction with nutrition counselling, significantly improved energy intake (3 trials; n=131; MD 393.57 kcal/day; 95% CI: 224.66 to 562.47;p<0.00001) and protein intake (2 trials; n=81; MD 23.5 g/day; 95% CI: 12.68, 34.01; p<0.00001) compared with no nutritional supplementation or nutrition counselling alone in adult participants with weight loss. In general supplementation with specific macronutrients such as amino acids, whey protein concentration or Spirulina did not significantly alter clinical, anthropometric or immunological outcomes compared with placebo in HIV-infected adults and children.Authors' conclusions: Given the current evidence base, which is limited to fourteen relatively small trials all evaluating different macronutrient supplements in different populations at different stages of HIV infection and with varying treatment status, no firm conclusions can be drawn about the effects of macronutrient supplementation on morbidity and mortality in people living with HIV. It is, however, promising to see more studies being conducted in low-income countries, and particularly in children, where macronutrient supplementation both pre-antiretroviral treatment and in conjunction with antiretroviral treatment might prove to be beneficial.US: http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD004536.pub3/abstractRecord #211 of 271ID: CD004805AU: Beyer Fiona RAU: Dickinson Heather OAU: Nicolson DonaldAU: Ford Gary AAU: Mason JamesTI: Combined calcium, magnesium and potassium supplementation for the management of primary hypertension in adultsSO: Cochrane Database of Systematic ReviewsYR: 2006NO: 3PB: John Wiley & Sons, LtdKY: Dietary Supplements;Blood Pressure [drug effects];Calcium, Dietary [administration & dosage];Drug Therapy, Combination;Hypertension [therapy];Magnesium [administration & dosage];Potassium, Dietary [administration & dosage];Adult[checkword];Humans[checkword]CC: HTNDOI: 10.1002/14651858.CD004805.pub2AB: Background: Previous research suggests that increasing dietary intakes of calcium, potassium or magnesium separately may reduce BP to a small degree over the short term. It is unclear whether increasing intakes of a combination of these minerals produces a larger reduction in BP.Objectives: To evaluate the effects of combined mineral supplementation as a treatment for primary hypertension in adults.Search methods: We searched the Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, EMBASE, Science Citation Index, ISI Proceedings, ClinicalTrials.gov, Current Controlled Trials, CAB abstracts, and reference lists of systematic reviews, meta-analyses and randomised controlled trials (RCTs) included in the review. The search was unrestricted by language or publication status.Selection criteria: Inclusion criteria were: 1) RCTs of a parallel or crossover design comparing oral supplements comprising a combination of potassium, and/or calcium, and/or magnesium with placebo, no treatment, or usual care; 2) treatment and follow-up >=8 weeks; 3) participants over 18 years old, with raised systolic blood pressure (SBP) >=140 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure (DBP) >=85 mmHg with no known primary cause; 4) SBP and DBP reported at end of follow-up. We excluded trials where participants were pregnant, or received antihypertensive medication which changed during the study.Data collection and analysis: Two reviewers independently extracted data and assessed trial quality. Disagreements were resolved by discussion or a third reviewer. Random effects meta-analyses and sensitivity analyses were conducted.Main results: We included three RCTs (n=277) with 24-28 weeks follow-up. Three combinations of minerals were investigated: potassium-magnesium, calcium-magnesium, and calcium-potassium. One trial investigated combinations of calcium-magnesium and of calcium-potassium, and for each found a statistically non-significant increase in both SBP and DBP. All three trials investigated the potassium-magnesium combination. None of the trials provided mortality or morbidity data. The potassium-magnesium combination compared to control resulted in statistically non-significant reductions in both SBP (mean difference = -4.6 mmHg, 95% CI: -9.9 to 0.7) and DBP (mean difference = -3.8 mmHg, 95% CI: -9.5 to 1.8), although the results were heterogeneous (I2=68% and 85% for SBP and DBP respectively).A sensitivity analysis using alternative reported values which accounted for missing data had very little effect on DBP but resulted in a larger, statistically significant reduction in SBP (mean difference = -5.8 mmHg, 95% CI: -10.5 to -1.0).The quality of the trials was not well reported.Authors' conclusions: We found no robust evidence that supplements of any combination of potassium, magnesium or calcium reduce mortality, morbidity or BP in adults. More trials are needed to investigate whether the combination of potassium & magnesium is effective.US: http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD004805.pub2/abstractRecord #212 of 271ID: CD002201AU: Oliver ColleenAU: Watson HelenTI: Omega-3 fatty acids for cystic fibrosisSO: Cochrane Database of Systematic ReviewsYR: 2016NO: 1PB: John Wiley & Sons, LtdKY: Dietary Supplements;Cystic Fibrosis [diet therapy];Fatty Acids, Omega-3 [administration & dosage];Fatty Acids, Omega-6 [administration & dosage];Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic;Adult[checkword];Child[checkword];Humans[checkword]DOI: 10.1002/14651858.CD002201.pub5AB: Background: Studies suggest that a diet rich in omega-3 essential fatty acids may have beneficial anti-inflammatory effects for chronic conditions such as cystic fibrosis. This is an updated version of a previously published review.Objectives: To determine whether there is evidence that omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid supplementation reduces morbidity and mortality and to identify any adverse events associated with supplementation.Search methods: We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group's Trials Register comprising references identified from comprehensive electronic database searches and handsearches of relevant journals and abstract books of conference proceedings. Authors and persons interested in the subject of the review were contacted.Date of last search: 13 August 2013.Selection criteria: Randomised controlled trials in people with cystic fibrosis comparing omega-3 fatty acid supplements with placebo.Data collection and analysis: Two authors independently selected studies for inclusion, extracted data and assessed the risk of bias of the studies.Main results: The searches identified 15 studies; four studies with 91 participants (children and adults) were included; duration of studies ranged from six weeks to six months. Two studies were judged to be at low risk of bias based on adequate randomisation but this was unclear in the other two studies. Three of the studies adequately blinded patients, however, the risk of bias was unclear in all studies with regards to allocation concealment and selective reporting.Two studies compared omega-3 fatty acids to olive oil for six weeks. One study compared a liquid dietary supplement containing omega-3 fatty acids to one without for six months. One study compared omega-3 fatty acids and omega-6 fatty acids to a control (capsules with customised fatty acid blends) for three months. Only one short-term study (19 participants) comparing omega-3 to placebo reported a significant improvement in lung function and Shwachman score and a reduction in sputum volume in the omega-3 group. Another study (43 participants) demonstrated a significant increase in serum phospholipid essential fatty acid content and a significant drop in the n-6/n-3 fatty acid ratio following omega-3 fatty acid supplementation compared to control. The longer-term study (17 participants) demonstrated a significant increase in essential fatty acid content in neutrophil membranes and a significant decrease in the leukotriene B4 to leukotriene B5 ratio in participants taking omega-3 supplements compared to placebo.Authors' conclusions: This review found that regular omega-3 supplements may provide some benefits for people with cystic fibrosis with relatively few adverse effects, although evidence is insufficient to draw firm conclusions or recommend routine use of these supplements in people with cystic fibrosis. This review has highlighted the lack of data for many outcomes meaningful to people with or making treatment decisions about cystic fibrosis.

This is an update of a Cochrane review first published in 2001 and previously updated in 2005.Objectives: To review randomized controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating the effectiveness and toxicity of glucosamine in OA.Search methods: We searched CENTRAL and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (The Cochrane Library), MEDLINE, PREMEDLINE, EMBASE, AMED, ACP Journal Club, DARE (to January 2008); contacted content experts, and handsearched reference lists and pertinent review articles.Selection criteria: RCTs evaluating the effectiveness and safety of glucosamine in OA.Data collection and analysis: Data abstraction was performed independently by two review authors and investigators were contacted for missing data.Main results: This update includes 25 studies with 4963 patients. Analysis restricted to studies with adequate allocation concealment failed to show any benefit of glucosamine for pain (based on a pooled measure of different pain scales) and WOMAC pain, function and stiffness subscales; however, it was found to be better than placebo using the Lequesne index (standardized mean difference (SMD) -0.54; 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.96 to -0.12). Collectively, the 25 RCTs favoured glucosamine with a 22% (change from baseline) improvement in pain (SMD -0.47; 95% CI -0.72 to -0.23) and a 11% (change from baseline) improvement in function using the Lequesne index (SMD -0.47; 95% CI -0.82 to -0.12). However, the results were not uniformly positive and the reasons for this remain unexplained. WOMAC pain, function and stiffness outcomes did not reach statistical significance.RCTs in which the Rotta preparation of glucosamine was compared to placebo found glucosamine superior for pain (SMD -1.11; 95% CI -1.66 to -0.57) and function (Lequesne index SMD -0.47; 95% CI -0.82 to -0.12). Pooled results for pain (SMD -0.05; 95% CI -0.15 to 0.05) and function using the WOMAC index (SMD -0.01; 95% CI -0.13 to 0.10) in those RCTs using a non-Rotta preparation of glucosamine did not reach statistical significance. Two RCTs using the Rotta preparation showed that glucosamine was able to slow radiological progression of OA of the knee over a three-year period (mean difference (MD) 0.32; 95% CI 0.05 to 0.58).Glucosamine was as safe as placebo in terms of the number of participants reporting adverse reactions (relative risk ratio 0.99; 95% CI 0.91 to 1.07).Authors' conclusions: Pooled results from studies using a non-Rotta preparation or adequate allocation concealment failed to show benefit in pain and WOMAC function while those studies evaluating the Rotta preparation showed that glucosamine was superior to placebo in the treatment of pain and functional impairment resulting from symptomatic OA.US: http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD002946.pub2/abstractRecord #214 of 271ID: CD004808AU: Bosch-Capblanch XavierAU: Abba KatharineAU: Prictor MeganAU: Garner PaulTI: Contracts between patients and healthcare practitioners for improving patients' adherence to treatment, prevention and health promotion activitiesSO: Cochrane Database of Systematic ReviewsYR: 2007NO: 2PB: John Wiley & Sons, LtdKY: Patient Compliance;Physician-Patient Relations;Community Participation;Contracts [standards];Health Promotion [methods];Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic;Humans[checkword]DOI: 10.1002/14651858.CD004808.pub3AB: Background: Contracts are a verbal or written agreement that a patient makes with themselves, with healthcare practitioners, or with carers, where participants commit to a set of behaviours related to the care of a patient. Contracts aim to improve the patients' adherence to treatment or health promotion programmes.Objectives: To assess the effects of contracts between patients and healthcare practitioners on patients' adherence to treatment, prevention and health promotion activities, the stated health or behaviour aims in the contract, patient satisfaction or other relevant outcomes, including health practitioner behaviour and views, health status, reported harms, costs, or denial of treatment as a result of the contract.Search methods: We searched: the Cochrane Consumers and Communication Review Group's Specialised Register (in May 2004); the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), (The Cochrane Library 2004, issue 1); MEDLINE 1966 to May 2004); EMBASE (1980 to May 2004); PsycINFO (1966 to May 2004); CINAHL (1982 to May 2004); Dissertation Abstracts.

Contracts had to specify at least one activity to be observed and a commitment of adherence to it. We included trials comparing contracts with routine care or any other intervention.Data collection and analysis: Selection and quality assessment of trials were conducted independently by two review authors; single data extraction was checked by a statistician. We present the data as a narrative summary, given the wide range of interventions, participants, settings and outcomes, grouped by the health problem being addressed.Main results: We included thirty trials, all conducted in high income countries, involving 4691 participants. Median sample size per group was 21. We examined the quality of each trial against eight standard criteria, and all trials were inadequate in relation to three or more of these standards. Trials evaluated contracts in addiction (10 trials), hypertension (4 trials), weight control (3 trials) and a variety of other areas (13 trials). Fifteen trials reported at least one outcome that showed statistically significant differences favouring the contracts group, six trials reported at least one outcome that showed differences favouring the control group and 26 trials reported at least one outcome without differences between groups. Effects on adherence were not detected when measured over longer periods.Authors' conclusions: There is limited evidence that contracts can potentially contribute to improving adherence, but there is insufficient evidence from large, good quality studies to routinely recommend contracts for improving adherence to treatment or preventive health regimens.US: http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD004808.pub3/abstractRecord #215 of 271ID: CD006659AU: Nasser MonaAU: Javaheri HodaAU: Fedorowicz ZbysAU: Noorani ZamanTI: Carnitine supplementation for inborn errors of metabolismSO: Cochrane Database of Systematic ReviewsYR: 2012NO: 2PB: John Wiley & Sons, LtdKY: Dietary Supplements;Carnitine [administration & dosage];Metabolism, Inborn Errors [therapy];Vitamin B Complex [administration & dosage];Humans[checkword];Infant[checkword]CC: CFDOI: 10.1002/14651858.CD006659.pub3AB: Background: Inborn errors of metabolism are genetic conditions which can lead to abnormalities in the synthesis and metabolism of proteins, carbohydrates, or fats. It has been proposed that in some instances carnitine supplementation should be provided to infants with a suspected metabolic disease as an interim measure, particularly whilst awaiting test results. Carnitine supplementation is used in the treatment of primary carnitine deficiency, and also where the deficiency is a secondary complication of several inborn errors of metabolism, such as organic acidaemias and fatty acid oxidation defects in children and adults.Objectives: To assess the effectiveness and safety of carnitine supplementation in the treatment of inborn errors of metabolism.Search methods: We searched the Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group's Inborn Errors of Metabolism Trials Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (The Cochrane Library 2007, Issue 4) and MEDLINE via Ovid (1950 to July week 4 2007), LILACS (15/05/2008) and Iranmedex (15/05/2008) and also the reference lists of retrieved articles.Date of most recent search of the Group's Inborn Errors of Metabolism Register: 27 October 2011.Selection criteria: Randomised controlled trials and quasi-randomised controlled trials comparing carnitine supplementation (in different dose, frequency, or duration) versus placebo in children and adults diagnosed with an inborn error of metabolism.Data collection and analysis: Two authors independently screened and assessed the eligibility of the identified trials.Main results: No trials were included in the review.Authors' conclusions: There are no published or ongoing randomised controlled clinical trials relevant to this review question. Therefore, in the absence of any high level evidence, clinicians should base their decisions on clinical experience and in conjunction with preferences of the individual where appropriate. This does not mean that carnitine is ineffective or should not be used in any inborn error of metabolism. However, given the lack of evidence both on the effectiveness and safety of carnitine and on the necessary dose and frequency to be prescribed, the current prescribing practice should continue to be observed and monitored with care until further evidence is available. Methodologically sound trials, reported according to the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) statement, are required. It should be considered whether placebo-controlled trials in potentially lethal diseases, e.g. carnitine transporter disorder or glutaric aciduria type I, are ethical.US: http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD006659.pub3/abstractRecord #216 of 271ID: CD011361AU: McBain HayleyAU: Mulligan KathleenAU: Haddad MarkAU: Flood ChrisAU: Jones JuliaAU: Simpson AlanTI: Self management interventions for type 2 diabetes in adult people with severe mental illnessSO: Cochrane Database of Systematic ReviewsYR: 2016NO: 4PB: John Wiley & Sons, LtdKY: Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2 [psychology] [therapy];Mental Disorders [complications];Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic;Self Care [methods];Adult[checkword];Humans[checkword]CC: ENDOCDOI: 10.1002/14651858.CD011361.pub2AB: Background: People with severe mental illness are twice as likely to develop type 2 diabetes as those without severe mental illness. Treatment guidelines for type 2 diabetes recommend that structured education should be integrated into routine care and should be offered to all. However, for people with severe mental illness, physical health may be a low priority, and motivation to change may be limited. These additional challenges mean that the findings reported in previous systematic reviews of diabetes self management interventions may not be generalised to those with severe mental illness, and that tailored approaches to effective diabetes education may be required for this population.Objectives: To assess the effects of diabetes self management interventions specifically tailored for people with type 2 diabetes and severe mental illness.Search methods: We searched the Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), the International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) Search Portal, ClinicalTrials.gov and grey literature. The date of the last search of all databases was 07 March 2016.Selection criteria: Randomised controlled trials of diabetes self management interventions for people with type 2 diabetes and severe mental illness.Data collection and analysis: Two review authors independently screened abstracts and full-text articles, extracted data and conducted the risk of bias assessment. We used a taxonomy of behaviour change techniques and the framework for behaviour change theory to describe the theoretical basis of the interventions and active ingredients. We used the GRADE method (Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation Working Group) to assess trials for overall quality of evidence.Main results: We included one randomised controlled trial involving 64 participants with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder. The average age of participants was 54 years; participants had been living with type 2 diabetes for on average nine years, and with their psychiatric diagnosis since they were on average 28 years of age. Investigators evaluated the 24-week Diabetes Awareness and Rehabilitation Training (DART) programme in comparison with usual care plus information (UCI). Follow-up after trial completion was six months. Risk of bias was mostly unclear but was high for selective reporting. Trial authors did not report on diabetes-related complications, all-cause mortality, adverse events, health-related quality of life nor socioeconomic effects. Twelve months of data on self care behaviours as measured by total energy expenditure showed a mean of 2148 kcal for DART and 1496 kcal for UCI (52 participants; very low-quality evidence), indicating no substantial improvement. The intervention did not have a substantial effect on glycosylated haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) at 6 or 12 months of follow-up (12-month HbA1c data 7.9% for DART vs 6.9% for UCI; 52 participants; very low-quality evidence). Researchers noted small improvements in body mass index immediately after the intervention was provided and at six months, along with improved weight post intervention. Diabetes knowledge and self efficacy improved immediately following receipt of the intervention, and knowledge also at six months. The intervention did not improve blood pressure.Authors' conclusions: Evidence is insufficient to show whether type 2 diabetes self management interventions for people with severe mental illness are effective in improving outcomes. Researchers must conduct additional trials to establish efficacy, and to identify the active ingredients in these interventions and the people most likely to benefit from them.US: http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD011361.pub2/abstractRecord #217 of 271ID: CD008427AU: Payne CathyAU: Wiffen Philip JAU: Martin SuzanneTI: Interventions for fatigue and weight loss in adults with advanced progressive illnessSO: Cochrane Database of Systematic ReviewsYR: 2012NO: 1PB: John Wiley & Sons, LtdKY: Weight Loss;Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis [complications];Cystic Fibrosis [complications];Disease Progression;Emaciation [etiology] [therapy];Fatigue [etiology] [therapy];HIV Infections [complications];Multiple Sclerosis [complications];Neoplasms [complications];Pulmonary Disease, Chronic Obstructive [complications];Review Literature as Topic;Adult[checkword];Humans[checkword]CC: SYMPTDOI: 10.1002/14651858.CD008427.pub2AB: Background: Fatigue and unintentional weight loss are two of the commonest symptoms experienced by people with advanced progressive illness. Appropriate interventions may bring considerable improvements in function and quality of life to seriously ill people and their families, reducing physical, psychological and spiritual distress.Objectives: To conduct an overview of the evidence available on the efficacy of interventions used in the management of fatigue and/or unintentional weight loss in adults with advanced progressive illness by reviewing the evidence contained within Cochrane reviews.Methods: We searched the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (CDSR) for all systematic reviews evaluating any interventions for the management of fatigue and/or unintentional weight loss in adults with advanced progressive illness (The Cochrane Library 2010, Issue 8). We reviewed titles of interest by abstract. Where the relevance of a review remained unclear we reached a consensus regarding the relevance of the participant group and the outcome measures to the overview. Two overview authors extracted the data independently using a data extraction form. We used the measurement tool AMSTAR (Assessment of Multiple SysTemAtic Reviews) to assess the methodological quality of each systematic review.Main results: We included 27 systematic reviews (302 studies with 31,833 participants) in the overview. None of the included systematic reviews reported quantitative data on the efficacy of interventions to manage fatigue or weight loss specific to people with advanced progressive illness. All of the included reviews apart from one were deemed of high methodological quality. For the remaining review we were unable to ascertain the methodological quality of the research strategy as it was described. None of the systematic reviews adequately described whether conflict of interests were present within the included studies. Management of fatigueAmyotrophic lateral sclerosis/motor neuron disease (ALS/MND) - we identified one systematic review (two studies and 52 participants); the intervention was exercise.Cancer - we identified five systematic reviews (116 studies with 17,342 participants); the pharmacological interventions were eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and any drug therapy for the management of cancer-related fatigue and the non pharmacological interventions were exercise, interventions by breast care nurses and psychosocial interventions.Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) - we identified three systematic reviews (59 studies and 4048 participants); the interventions were self management education programmes, nutritional support and pulmonary rehabilitation.Cystic fibrosis - we identified one systematic review (nine studies and 833 participants); the intervention was physical training.Human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immune deficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS) - we identified two systematic reviews (21 studies and 748 participants); the interventions were progressive resistive exercise and aerobic exercise.Multiple sclerosis (MS) - we identified five systematic reviews (23 studies and 1502 participants); the pharmacological interventions were amantadine and carnitine. The non pharmacological interventions were diet, exercise and occupational therapy.Mixed conditions in advanced stages of illness - we identified one systematic review (five studies and 453 participants); the intervention was medically assisted hydration. Management of weight lossALS/MND - we identified one systematic review but no studies met the inclusion criteria for the systematic review; the intervention was enteral tube feeding.Cancer - we identified three systematic reviews with a fourth systematic review also containing extractable data on cancer (66 studies and 5601 participants); the pharmacological interventions were megestrol acetate and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) (this systematic review is also included in the cancer fatigue section above). The non pharmacological interventions were enteral tube feeding and non invasive interventions for patients with lung cancer.COPD - we identified one systematic review (59 studies and 4048 participants); the intervention was nutritional support. This systematic review is also included in the COPD fatigue section.Cystic fibrosis - we identified two systematic reviews (three studies and 131 participants); the interventions were enteral tube feeding and oral calorie supplements.HIV/AIDS - we identified four systematic reviews (42 studies and 2071 participants); the pharmacological intervention was anabolic steroids. The non pharmacological interventions were nutritional interventions, progressive resistive exercise and aerobic exercise. Both of the systematic reviews on exercise interventions were also included in the HIV/AIDS fatigue section.MS - we found no systematic reviews which considered interventions to manage unintentional weight loss for people with a clinical diagnosis of multiple sclerosis at any stage of illness.Mixed conditions in advanced stages of illness - we identified two systematic reviews (32 studies and 4826 participants); the interventions were megestrol acetate and medically assisted nutrition.Authors' conclusions: There is a lack of robust evidence for interventions to manage fatigue and/or unintentional weight loss in the advanced stage of progressive illnesses such as advanced cancer, heart failure, lung failure, cystic fibrosis, multiple sclerosis, motor neuron disease, Parkinson's disease, dementia and AIDS. The evidence contained within this overview provides some insight into interventions which may prove of benefit within this population such as exercise, some pharmacological treatments and support for self management.Researchers could improve the methodological quality of future studies by blinding of outcome assessors. Adopting uniform reporting mechanisms for fatigue and weight loss outcome measures would also allow the opportunity for meta-analysis of small studies.Researchers could also improve the applicability of recommendations for interventions to manage fatigue and unintentional weight loss in advanced progressive illness by including subgroup analysis of this population within systematic reviews of applicable interventions.More research is required to ascertain the best interventions to manage fatigue and/or weight loss in advanced illness. There is a need for standardised reporting of these symptoms and agreement amongst researchers of the minimum duration of studies and minimum percentage change in symptom experience that proves the benefits of an intervention. There are, however, challenges in providing meaningful outcome measurements against a background of deteriorating health through disease progression. Interventions to manage these symptoms must also be mindful of the impact on quality of life and should be focused on patient-orientated rather than purely disease-orientated experiences for patients. Systematic reviews and primary intervention studies should include the impact of the interventions on standardised validated quality of life measures.US: http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD008427.pub2/abstractRecord #218 of 271ID: CD010873AU: Ng Ruey TerngAU: Lee Way SeahAU: Ang Hak LeeAU: Teo Kai MingAU: Yik Yee IanAU: Lai Nai MingTI: Transcutaneous electrical stimulation (TES) for treatment of constipation in childrenSO: Cochrane Database of Systematic ReviewsYR: 2016NO: 11PB: John Wiley & Sons, LtdKY: Transcutaneous Electric Nerve Stimulation;Chronic Disease;Constipation [therapy];Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic;Adolescent[checkword];Child[checkword];Humans[checkword]DOI: 10.1002/14651858.CD010873.pub4AB: Background: Childhood constipation is a common problem with substantial health, economic and emotional burdens. Existing therapeutic options, mainly pharmacological, are not consistently effective, and some are associated with adverse effects after prolonged use. Transcutaneous electrical stimulation (TES), a non-pharmacological approach, is postulated to facilitate bowel movement by modulating the nerves of the large bowel via the application of electrical current transmitted through the abdominal wall.Objectives: Our main objective was to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of TES when employed to improve bowel function and constipation-related symptoms in children with constipation.Search methods: We searched MEDLINE (PubMed) (1950 to July 2015), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library, Issue 7, 2015), EMBASE (1980 to July 2015), the Cochrane IBD Group Specialized Register, trial registries and conference proceedings to identify applicable studies .Selection criteria: Randomized controlled trials that assessed any type of TES, administered at home or in a clinical setting, compared to no treatment, a sham TES, other forms of nerve stimulation or any other pharmaceutical or non-pharmaceutical measures used to treat constipation in children were considered for inclusion.Data collection and analysis: Two authors independently assessed studies for inclusion, extracted data and assessed risk of bias of the included studies. We calculated the risk ratio (RR) and corresponding 95% confidence interval (CI) for categorical outcomes data and the mean difference (MD) and corresponding 95% CI for continuous outcomes. We evaluated the overall quality of the evidence supporting the outcomes assessed in this review using the GRADE criteria.Main results: One study from Australia including 46 children aged 8 to 18 years was eligible for inclusion. There were multiple reports identified, including one unpublished report, that focused on different outcomes of the same study. The study had unclear risk of selection bias, high risks of performance, detection and attrition biases, and low risks of reporting biases.We are very uncertain about the effects of TES on bowel movements, colonic transit, soiling symptoms and quality of life due to high risk of bias, indirectness and imprecision. For our outcomes of interest the 95% CI of most analysis results include potential benefit and no effect. There is insufficient evidence to determine the effect of TES on bowel movements and colonic transit. The study reported that 16/21 children in the TES group and 15/21 in the sham group had > 3 complete spontaneous bowel movements (CSBM) per week (RR 1.07, 95% CI 0.74 to 1.53; very low-quality evidence). Ten out of 14 children in the TES group had improved colonic transit compared to 1/7 in the sham group (RR 5.00, 95% CI 0.79 to 31.63; very low-quality evidence). Mean colonic transit rate, measured as the position of the geometric centre of the radioactive substance ingested along the intestinal tract, was higher in children who received TES compared to sham (MD 1.05, 95% CI 0.36 to 1.74; one study, 30 participants; very low-quality evidence). The radiological assessment of colonic transit outcomes means that these results might not translate to important improvement in clinical symptoms or increased bowel movements. There is insufficient evidence to determine the effect of TES on symptoms and quality of life (QoL) outcomes. Nine out of 13 children in the TES group had improved soiling-related symptoms compared to 4/12 sham participants (RR 2.08, 95% CI 0.86 to 5.00; very low-quality evidence). Four out of 8 TES participants reported an improvement in QoL compared to 1/8 sham participants (RR 4.00, 95% CI 0.56 to 28.40; very low-quality evidence). The effects of TES on self-perceived (MD 5.00, 95% CI -1.21 to 11.21; one study, 33 participants; very low-quality evidence) or parent-perceived QoL (MD -0.20, 95% CI -7.57 to 7.17, one study, 33 participants; very low-quality evidence) are uncertain. No adverse effects were reported in the included study.Authors' conclusions: The results for the outcomes assessed in this review are uncertain. Thus no firm conclusions regarding the efficacy and safety of TES in children with chronic constipation can be drawn. Further randomized controlled trials assessing TES for the management of childhood constipation should be conducted. Future trials should include clear documentation of methodologies, especially measures to evaluate the effectiveness of blinding, and incorporate patient-important outcomes such as the number of patients with improved CSBM, improved clinical symptoms and quality of life.US: http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD010873.pub4/abstractRecord #219 of 271ID: CD006867AU: Agarwal VisheshAU: Abhijnhan AkhilAU: Raviraj PrakashTI: Ayurvedic medicine for schizophreniaSO: Cochrane Database of Systematic ReviewsYR: 2007NO: 4PB: John Wiley & Sons, LtdKY: Medicine, Ayurvedic;Antipsychotic Agents [therapeutic use];Phytotherapy [methods];Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic;Schizophrenia [drug therapy];Humans[checkword]CC: SCHIZDOI: 10.1002/14651858.CD006867AB: Background: Ayurvedic medicine has been used to treat mental health problems since1000 BC.Objectives: To review effects of Ayurvedic medicine or treatments for schizophrenia.Search methods: We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group Trials Register (March 2007) and AMED (March 2007), inspected references of all identified studies and contacted the first author of each included study.Selection criteria: We included all clinical randomised trials comparing Ayurvedic medicine or treatments with placebo, typical or atypical antipsychotic drugs for schizophrenia and schizophrenia-like psychoses.Data collection and analysis: We independently extracted data and calculated random effects, relative risk (RR), 95% confidence intervals (CI) and, where appropriate, numbers needed to treat/harm (NNT/H) on an intention-to-treat basis. For continuous data, we calculated weighted mean differences (WMD).Main results: From the three small (total n=250) short included studies, we were unable to extract any data on many broad clinically important outcomes such as global state, use of services, and satisfaction with treatment. When Ayurvedic herbs were compared with placebo, about 20% of people left the studies early (n=120, 2 RCTs, RR 0.77 CI 0.37 to 1.62). Mental state ratings were mostly equivocal with the exception of the brahmyadiyoga group using Ayurvedic assessment (n=68, 1 RCT, RR not improved 0.56 CI 0.36 to 0.88, NNT 4 CI 3 to 12). Behaviour seemed unchanged (n=43, 1 RCT, WMD Fergus Falls Behaviour Rating 1.14 CI -1.63 to 3.91). Nausea and vomiting were common in the brahmyadiyoga group (n=43, RR 13.13 CI 0.80 to 216.30). When the Ayurvedic herbs were compared with antipsychotic drugs (chlorpromazine), again, equal numbers left the study early (n=120, 2 RCTs, RR for brahmyadiyoga 0.91 CI 0.42 to 1.97) but people allocated herbs were at greater risk of no improvement in mental state compared to those allocated chlorpromazine (n=45, RR 1.82 CI 1.11 to 2.98). Again, nausea and vomiting were found with use of brahmyadiyoga (n=45, 1 RCT, RR 20.45 CI 1.09 to 383.97, NNH 2 CI 2 to 38). Finally, when Ayurvedic treatment, in this case a complex mixture of many herbs, is compared with chlorpromazine in acutely ill people with schizophrenia, it is equally (˜10% attrition, n=36, RR 0.67 CI 0.13 to 3.53), but skewed data does seem to favour the chlorpromazine group.Authors' conclusions: Ayurvedic medication may have some effects for treatment of schizophrenia, but has been evaluated only in a few small pioneering trials.US: http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD006867/abstractRecord #220 of 271ID: CD005433AU: MacGillivray StephenAU: Fahey TomAU: McGuire WilliamTI: Lactose avoidance for young children with acute diarrhoeaSO: Cochrane Database of Systematic ReviewsYR: 2013NO: 10PB: John Wiley & Sons, LtdKY: Acute Disease;Dairy Products [adverse effects];Diarrhea, Infantile [prevention & control];Lactose [administration & dosage] [adverse effects];Milk [chemistry];Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic;Animals[checkword];Humans[checkword];Infant[checkword]CC: INFECTNDOI: 10.1002/14651858.CD005433.pub2AB: Background: Young children with acute diarrhoea, typically due to infectious gastroenteritis, may temporarily stop producing lactase, the intestinal enzyme that digests lactose. This means they may not digest lactose, the main sugar in milk, and this may worsen or prolong the diarrhoeal illness. However, there is uncertainty whether avoiding lactose-containing milk or milk products helps young children recover from acute diarrhoea more quickly.Objectives: To assess if avoiding or reducing intake of lactose-containing milk or milk products shortens the duration and severity of illness in young children with acute diarrhoea. We also sought other indicators of morbidity and overall mortality.Search methods: We searched the Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group Specialized Register (14 May 2013), Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) published in The Cochrane Library (Issue 4, 2013), MEDLINE (1996 to 14 May 2013), EMBASE (1974 to 14 May 2013), and LILACS (1982 to 14 May 2013), and the reference lists of potentially relevant trials, key conference proceedings, and wrote to individuals and organizations in the field.Selection criteria: Randomized or quasi-randomized controlled trials that assessed the effects of avoiding or reducing exposure to lactose in young children under five years with acute diarrhoea.Data collection and analysis: We extracted data using the standard methods of the Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group, and two review authors independently evaluated trial quality and data extraction. Continuous outcomes were compared using mean difference (MD), and dichotomous outcomes using the risk ratio (RR). We presented all results with 95% confidence intervals (CI) and assessed the quality of evidence using the GRADE approach.Main results: We included 33 trials enrolling 2973 children with acute diarrhoea. Twenty-nine trials were exclusively conducted on inpatients, all from high- or middle-income countries. Fifteen trials included children aged below 12 months, and 22 excluded children who were being breast-fed.Compared to lactose-containing milk, milk products, or foodstuffs, lactose-free products may reduce the duration of diarrhoea by an average of about 18 hours (MD -17.77, 95% CI -25.32 to -10.21, 16 trials, 1467 participants, low quality evidence). Lactose-free products probably also reduce treatment failure (defined variously as continued or worsening diarrhoea or vomiting, the need for additional rehydration therapy, or continuing weight loss) by around a half (RR 0.52, 95% CI 0.39 to 0.68, 18 trials, 1470 participants, moderate quality evidence).Diluted lactose-containing milk has not been shown to reduce the duration of diarrhoea compared to undiluted milk or milk products (five trials, 417 participants, low quality evidence), but may reduce the risk of treatment failure (RR 0.65, 95% CI 0.45 to 0.94, nine trials, 687 participants, low quality evidence).Authors' conclusions: In young children with acute diarrhoea who are not predominantly breast-fed, change to a lactose-free diet may result in earlier resolution of acute diarrhoea and reduce treatment failure. Diluting lactose-containing formulas may also have some benefits but further trials are required to have confidence in this finding. There are no trials from low-income countries, where mortality for diarrhoea is high, and malnutrition is more common.US: http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD005433.pub2/abstractRecord #221 of 271ID: CD003286AU: Loveman EmmaAU: Royle PamelaAU: Waugh NormanTI: Specialist nurses in diabetes mellitusSO: Cochrane Database of Systematic ReviewsYR: 2003NO: 2PB: John Wiley & Sons, LtdKY: Specialties, Nursing;Case Management;Diabetes Mellitus [nursing];Quality of Life;Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic;Humans[checkword]CC: ENDOCDOI: 10.1002/14651858.CD003286AB: Background: The patient with diabetes has many different learning needs relating to diet, monitoring, and treatments. In many health care systems specialist nurses provide much of these needs, usually aiming to empower patients to self-manage their diabetes. The present review aims to assess the effects of the involvement of specialist nurse care on outcomes for people with diabetes, compared to usual care in hospital clinics or primary care with no input from specialist nurses.Objectives: To assess the effects of diabetes specialist nurses / nurse case manager in diabetes on the metabolic control of patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes mellitus.Search methods: We carried out a comprehensive search of databases including the Cochrane Library, MEDLINE and EMBASE to identify trials. Bibliographies of relevant papers were searched, and hand searching of relevant publications was undertaken to identify additional trials.Selection criteria: Randomised controlled trials and controlled clinical trials of the effects of a specialist nurse practitioner on short and long term diabetic outcomes were included in the review.Data collection and analysis: Three investigators performed data extraction and quality scoring independently; any discrepancies were resolved by consensus.Main results: Six trials including 1382 participants followed for six to 12 months were included. Two trials were in adolescents. Due to substantial heterogeneity between trials a meta-analysis was not performed. Glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) in the intervention groups was not found to be significantly different from the control groups over a 12 month follow up period. One study demonstrated a significant reduction in HbA1c in the presence of the diabetes specialist nurse/nurse case manager at 6 months. Significant differences in episodes of hypoglycaemia and hyperglycaemia between intervention and control groups were found in one trial. Where reported, emergency admissions and quality of life were not found to be significantly different between groups. No information was found regarding BMI, mortality, long term diabetic complications, adverse effects, or costs.Authors' conclusions: The presence of a diabetes specialist nurse / nurse case manager may improve patients' diabetic control over short time periods, but from currently available trials the effects over longer periods of time are not evident. There were no significant differences overall in hypoglycaemic episodes, hyperglycaemic incidents, or hospital admissions. Quality of life was not shown to be affected by input from a diabetes specialist nurse/nurse case manager.US: http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD003286/abstractRecord #222 of 271ID: CD006219AU: Farley Amanda CAU: Hajek PeterAU: Lycett DeborahAU: Aveyard PaulTI: Interventions for preventing weight gain after smoking cessationSO: Cochrane Database of Systematic ReviewsYR: 2012NO: 1PB: John Wiley & Sons, LtdKY: Weight Gain [drug effects];Antidepressive Agents [therapeutic use];Benzazepines [administration & dosage];Exercise;Nicotine [administration & dosage];Nicotinic Agonists [administration & dosage];Piperidines [administration & dosage];Pyrazoles [administration & dosage];Quinoxalines [administration & dosage];Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic;Smoking Cessation [methods];Female[checkword];Humans[checkword];Male[checkword]CC: TOBACCODOI: 10.1002/14651858.CD006219.pub3AB: Background: Most people who stop smoking gain weight. There are some interventions that have been designed to reduce weight gain when stopping smoking. Some smoking cessation interventions may also limit weight gain although their effect on weight has not been reviewed.Objectives: To systematically review the effect of: (1) Interventions targeting post-cessation weight gain on weight change and smoking cessation.(2) Interventions designed to aid smoking cessation that may also plausibly affect weight on post-cessation weight change.Search methods: Part 1 - We searched the Cochrane Tobacco Addiction Group's Specialized Register and CENTRAL in September 2011.Part 2 - In addition we searched the included studies in the following "parent" Cochrane reviews: nicotine replacement therapy (NRT), antidepressants, nicotine receptor partial agonists, cannabinoid type 1 receptor antagonists and exercise interventions for smoking cessation published in Issue 9, 2011 of the Cochrane Library.Selection criteria: Part 1 - We included trials of interventions that were targeted at post-cessation weight gain and had measured weight at any follow up point and/or smoking cessation six or more months after quit day.Part 2 - We included trials that had been included in the selected parent Cochrane reviews if they had reported weight gain at any time point.Data collection and analysis: We extracted data on baseline characteristics of the study population, intervention, outcome and study quality. Change in weight was expressed as difference in weight change from baseline to follow up between trial arms and was reported in abstinent smokers only. Abstinence from smoking was expressed as a risk ratio (RR). We used the most rigorous definition of abstinence available in each trial. Where appropriate, we performed meta-analysis using the inverse variance method for weight and Mantel-Haenszel method for smoking using a fixed-effect model.Main results: Part 1: Some pharmacological interventions tested for limiting post cessation weight gain (PCWG) resulted in a significant reduction in WG at the end of treatment (dexfenfluramine (Mean difference (MD) -2.50 kg, 95% confidence interval (CI) -2.98 to -2.02, 1 study), phenylpropanolamine (MD -0.50 kg, 95% CI -0.80 to -0.20, N=3), naltrexone (MD -0.78 kg, 95% CI -1.52 to -0.05, N=2). There was no evidence that treatment reduced weight at 6 or 12 months (m). No pharmacological intervention significantly affected smoking cessation rates.Weight management education only was associated with no reduction in PCWG at end of treatment (6 or 12m). However these interventions significantly reduced abstinence at 12m (Risk ratio (RR) 0.66, 95% CI 0.48 to 0.90, N=2). Personalised weight management support reduced PCWG at 12m (MD -2.58 kg, 95% CI -5.11 to -0.05, N=2) and was not associated with a significant reduction of abstinence at 12m (RR 0.74, 95% CI 0.39 to 1.43, N=2). A very low calorie diet (VLCD) significantly reduced PCWG at end of treatment (MD -3.70 kg, 95% CI -4.82 to -2.58, N=1), but not significantly so at 12m (MD -1.30 kg, 95% CI -3.49 to 0.89, N=1). The VLCD increased chances of abstinence at 12m (RR 1.73, 95% CI 1.10 to 2.73, N=1). There was no evidence that cognitive behavioural therapy to allay concern about weight gain (CBT) reduced PCWG, but there was some evidence of increased PCWG at 6m (MD 0.74, 95% CI 0.24 to 1.24). It was associated with improved abstinence at 6m (RR 1.83, 95% CI 1.07 to 3.13, N=2) but not at 12m (RR 1.25, 95% CI 0.83 to 1.86, N=2). However, there was significant statistical heterogeneity.Part 2: We found no evidence that exercise interventions significantly reduced PCWG at end of treatment (MD -0.25 kg, 95% CI -0.78 to 0.29, N=4) however a significant reduction was found at 12m (MD -2.07 kg, 95% CI -3.78 to -0.36, N=3).Both bupropion and fluoxetine limited PCWG at the end of treatment (bupropion MD -1.12 kg, 95% CI -1.47 to -0.77, N=7) (fluoxetine MD -0.99 kg, 95% CI -1.36 to -0.61, N=2). There was no evidence that the effect persisted at 6m (bupropion MD -0.58 kg, 95% CI -2.16 to 1.00, N=4), (fluoxetine MD -0.01 kg, 95% CI -1.11 to 1.10, N=2) or 12m (bupropion MD -0.38 kg, 95% CI -2.00 to 1.24, N=4). There were no data on WG at 12m for fluoxetine.Overall, treatment with NRT attenuated PCWG at the end of treatment (MD -0.69 kg, 95% CI -0.88 to -0.51, N=19), with no strong evidence that the effect differed for the different forms of NRT. There was evidence of significant statistical heterogeneity caused by one study which reported a 4.3 kg reduction in PCWG due to NRT. With this study removed, the difference in weight change at end of treatment was -0.45 kg (95% CI -0.66 to -0.27, N=18). There was no evidence of an effect on PCWG at 12m (MD -0.42 kg, 95% CI -0.92 to 0.08, N=15).We found evidence that varenicline significantly reduced PCWG at end of treatment (MD -0.41 kg, 95% CI -0.63 to -0.19, N=11), but this effect was not maintained at 6 or 12m. Three studies compared the effect of bupropion to varenicline. Participants taking bupropion gained significantly less weight at the end of treatment (-0.51 kg (95% CI -0.93 to -0.09 kg), N=3). Direct comparison showed no significant difference in PCWG between varenicline and NRT.Authors' conclusions: Although some pharmacotherapies tested to limit PCWG show evidence of short-term success, other problems with them and the lack of data on long-term efficacy limits their use. Weight management education only, is not effective and may reduce abstinence. Personalised weight management support may be effective and not reduce abstinence, but there are too few data to be sure. One study showed a VLCD increased abstinence but did not prevent WG in the longer term. CBT to accept WG did not limit PCWG and may not promote abstinence in the long term. Exercise interventions significantly reduced weight in the long term, but not the short term. More studies are needed to clarify whether this is an effect of treatment or a chance finding. Bupropion, fluoxetine, NRT and varenicline reduce PCWG while using the medication. Although this effect was not maintained one year after stopping smoking, the evidence is insufficient to exclude a modest long-term effect. The data are not sufficient to make strong clinical recommendations for effective programmes to prevent weight gain after cessation.US: http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD006219.pub3/abstractRecord #223 of 271ID: CD002111AU: Norton ChristineAU: Cody June DTI: Biofeedback and/or sphincter exercises for the treatment of faecal incontinence in adultsSO: Cochrane Database of Systematic ReviewsYR: 2012NO: 7PB: John Wiley & Sons, LtdKY: Anal Canal;Combined Modality Therapy [methods];Electric Stimulation Therapy [methods];Exercise Therapy [methods];Fecal Incontinence [therapy];Feedback, Sensory [physiology];Pelvic Floor;Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic;Treatment Outcome;Adult[checkword];Female[checkword];Humans[checkword];Male[checkword]CC: INCONTDOI: 10.1002/14651858.CD002111.pub3AB: Background: Faecal incontinence is a particularly embarrassing and distressing condition with significant medical, social and economic implications. Anal sphincter exercises (pelvic floor muscle training) and biofeedback therapy have been used to treat the symptoms of people with faecal incontinence. However, standards of treatment are still lacking and the magnitude of alleged benefits has yet to be established.Objectives: To determine the effects of biofeedback and/or anal sphincter exercises/pelvic floor muscle training for the treatment of faecal incontinence in adults.Search methods: We searched the Cochrane Incontinence Group Specialised Trials Register (searched 24 January 2012) which contains trials from searching CENTRAL, MEDLINE and handsearching of conference proceedings; and the reference lists of relevant articles.Selection criteria: All randomised or quasi-randomised trials evaluating biofeedback and/or anal sphincter exercises in adults with faecal incontinence.Data collection and analysis: Two review authors assessed the risk of bias of eligible trials and two review authors independently extracted data from the included trials. A wide range of outcome measures were considered.Main results: Twenty one eligible studies were identified with a total of 1525 participants. About half of the trials had low risk of bias for randomisation and allocation concealment.One small trial showed that biofeedback plus exercises was better than exercises alone (RR for failing to achieve full continence 0.70, 95% CI 0.52 to 0.94).One small trial showed that adding biofeedback to electrical stimulation was better than electrical stimulation alone (RR for failing to achieve full continence 0.47, 95% CI 0.33 to 0.65).The combined data of two trials showed that the number of people failing to achieve full continence was significantly lower when electrical stimulation was added to biofeedback compared against biofeedback alone (RR 0.60, 95% CI 0.46 to 0.78).Sacral nerve stimulation was better than conservative management which included biofeedback and PFMT (at 12 months the incontinence episodes were significantly fewer with sacral nerve stimulation (MD 6.30, 95% CI 2.26 to 10.34).There was not enough evidence as to whether there was a difference in outcome between any method of biofeedback or exercises. There are suggestions that rectal volume discrimination training improves continence more than sham training. Further conclusions are not warranted from the available data.Authors' conclusions: The limited number of identified trials together with methodological weaknesses of many do not allow a definitive assessment of the role of anal sphincter exercises and biofeedback therapy in the management of people with faecal incontinence. We found some evidence that biofeedback and electrical stimulation may enhance the outcome of treatment compared to electrical stimulation alone or exercises alone. Exercises appear to be less effective than an implanted sacral nerve stimulator. While there is a suggestion that some elements of biofeedback therapy and sphincter exercises may have a therapeutic effect, this is not certain. Larger well-designed trials are needed to enable safe conclusions.US: http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD002111.pub3/abstractRecord #224 of 271ID: CD004322AU: Perera NirmalAU: Liolitsa DanaeAU: Iype SatheeshAU: Croxford AnnaAU: Yassin MuhammedAU: Lang PeterAU: Ukaegbu ObiohaAU: van Issum ChristopherTI: Phlebotonics for haemorrhoidsSO: Cochrane Database of Systematic ReviewsYR: 2012NO: 8PB: John Wiley & Sons, LtdKY: Calcium Dobesilate [therapeutic use];Diosmin [therapeutic use];Flavonoids [therapeutic use];Hemorrhoids [therapy];Hemostatics [therapeutic use];Hydroxyethylrutoside [analogs & derivatives] [therapeutic use];Ligation [methods];Postoperative Care;Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic;Vasoconstrictor Agents [therapeutic use];Humans[checkword]DOI: 10.1002/14651858.CD004322.pub3AB: Background: Haemorrhoids are variceal dilatations of the anal and perianal venous plexus and often develop secondary to the persistently elevated venous pressure within the haemorrhoidal plexus (Kumar 2005). Phlebotonics are a heterogenous class of drugs consisting of plant extracts (i.e. flavonoids) and synthetic compounds (i.e. calcium dobesilate). Although their precise mechanism of action has not been fully established, they are known to improve venous tone, stabilize capillary permeability and increase lymphatic drainage. They have been used to treat a variety of conditions including chronic venous insufficiency, lymphoedema and haemorrhoids.Numerous trials assessing the effect of phlebotonics in treating the symptoms and signs of haemorrhoidal disease suggest that there is a potential benefit.Objectives: The aim of this review was to investigate the efficacy of phlebotonics in alleviating the signs, symptoms and severity of haemorrhoidal disease and verify their effect post-haemorrhoidectomy.Search methods: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) in the Cochrane Library 2011 issue 9 , MEDLINE (1950 to September 2011) and EMBASE (1974 to September 2011).Selection criteria: Only randomised controlled trials evaluating the use of phlebotonics in treating haemorrhoidal disease were used. No cross-over or cluster-randomized trials were included for analysis and any trial which had a quasi-random method of allocation was excluded.Data collection and analysis: Two authors independently extracted the data and analysed the eligibility of the data for inclusion. Disagreements were resolved by meaningful discussion.Main results: We considered twenty-four studies for inclusion in the final analysis. Twenty of these studies (enrolling a total of 2344 participants) evaluated the use of phlebotonics versus a control intervention. One of these twenty studies evaluated the use of phlebotonics with a medical intervention and another study with rubber band ligation.The remaining four studies included two which compared different forms of phlebotonics with each other, one study which evaluated phlebotonics with a medical intervention and one study which compared the use of phlebotonics with infrared photocoagulation. Eight studies were excluded for various reasons including poor methodological quality.Phlebotonics demonstrated a statistically significant beneficial effect for the outcomes of  pruritus (OR 0.23; 95% CI 0.07 to 0.79) (P=0.02), bleeding (OR 0.12; 95% CI 0.04 to 0.37) (P=0.0002), bleeding post-haemorrhoidectomy (OR 0.18; 95% 0.06 to 0.58)(P=0.004), discharge and leakage (OR 0.12; 95% CI 0.04 to 0.42) (P=0.0008) and overall symptom improvement (OR 15.99 95% CI 5.97 to 42.84) (P< 0.00001), in comparison with a control intervention. Although beneficial they did not show a statistically significant effect compared with a control intervention for pain (OR 0.11; 95% CI 0.01 to 1.11) (P=0.06), pain scores post-haemorrhoidectomy (SMD -1.04; 95% CI -3.21 to 1.12 ) (P= 0.35) or post-operative analgesic consumption (OR 0.54; 95% CI 0.30 to 0.99)(P=0.05).Authors' conclusions: The evidence suggests that there is a potential benefit in using phlebotonics in treating haemorrhoidal disease as well as a benefit in alleviating post-haemorrhoidectomy symptoms. Outcomes such as bleeding and overall symptom improvement show a statistically significant beneficial effect and there were few concerns regarding their overall safety from the evidence presented in the clinical trials.However methodological limitations were encountered. In order to enhance our conclusion further, more robust clinical trials which take into account these limitations will need to be performed in the future.US: http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD004322.pub3/abstractRecord #225 of 271ID: CD012170AU: Flatz AlineAU: Pfeifer NadineAU: Radtke ThomasAU: Kriemler SusiAU: Klerings IrmaAU: Wolfenden LukeAU: von Elm ErikTI: Interventions implemented through sporting organisations for promoting healthy behaviour or improving health outcomesSO: Cochrane Database of Systematic ReviewsYR: 2016NO: 5PB: John Wiley & Sons, LtdCC: PUBHLTHDOI: 10.1002/14651858.CD012170AB: : This is the protocol for a review and there is no abstract.

Thiamine has been established as the treatment of choice for over 50 years, but uncertainty remains about appropriate dosage and duration. Current practice guidelines are based on case reports and clinical experience. This is an update of a review first published in 2004 and last updated in 2008.Objectives: • To assess the efficacy of thiamine in preventing and treating the manifestations of WKS due to excess alcohol consumption.  • To determine the optimum form, dose and duration of thiamine treatment for this indication.Search methods: ALOIS, the Specialized Register of the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group (CDCIG), The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, CINAHL and LILACS were searched on 6 September 2012 using the term thiamine OR aneurine. ALOIS contains records from all major health care databases (The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, CINAHL, LILACS) as well as from many trial databases and grey literature sources.Selection criteria: Any randomised trials comparing thiamine with alternative interventions or comparing different thiamine regimens (varying in formulation, dose or duration of administration).Data collection and analysis: All abstracts were independently inspected by two reviewers (ED and PWB), and relevant articles were retrieved and assessed for methodological quality using criteria provided in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions.Main results: Two studies were identified that met the inclusion criteria, but only one contained sufficient data for quantitative analysis. Ambrose (2001) randomly assigned participants (n = 107) to one of five doses of intramuscular thiamine and measured outcomes after 2 days of treatment. We compared the lowest dose (5 mg/day) with each of the other four doses. A significant difference favoured 200 mg/day compared with the 5-mg/day dose in determining the number of trials needed to meet inclusion criteria on a delayed alternation test (mean difference (MD) -17.90, 95% confidence interval (CI) -35.4 to -0.40, P = 0.04). No significant differences emerged when the other doses were compared with 5 mg/day. The pattern of results did not reflect a simple dose-response relationship. The study had methodological shortcomings in design and in the presentation of results that limited further analysis.Authors' conclusions: Evidence from randomised controlled clinical trials is insufficient to guide clinicians in determining the dose, frequency, route or duration of thiamine treatment for prophylaxis against or treatment of WKS due to alcohol abuse.US: http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD004033.pub3/abstractRecord #227 of 271ID: CD009968AU: Regan JulieAU: Murphy AnneAU: Chiang MindyAU: McMahon Barry PAU: Coughlan TaraAU: Walshe MargaretTI: Botulinum toxin for upper oesophageal sphincter dysfunction in neurological swallowing disordersSO: Cochrane Database of Systematic ReviewsYR: 2014NO: 5PB: John Wiley & Sons, LtdKY: Anti-Dyskinesia Agents [therapeutic use];Botulinum Toxins [therapeutic use];Deglutition [drug effects] [physiology];Deglutition Disorders [drug therapy] [etiology];Esophageal Sphincter, Upper;Nervous System Diseases [complications];Humans[checkword]CC: UPPERGIDOI: 10.1002/14651858.CD009968.pub2AB: Background: Adequate upper oesophageal sphincter (UOS) opening is critical to safe and efficient swallowing due to the close proximity of the UOS to the airway entrance. Many people with neurological conditions, progressive and non-progressive, present with UOS dysfunction. The consequences for the person include difficulty swallowing food with subsequent choking and aspiration (passage of material into the trachea beyond the level of the true vocal cords). Clinical complications include aspiration pneumonia, weight loss, dehydration and malnutrition. Tube feeding is often indicated but is associated with increased mortality. Quality of life is also frequently impacted. A range of interventions exist that aim to improve UOS function and swallowing. These include compensatory strategies, rehabilitation techniques, pharmacological interventions and surgery. Over the last two decades, botulinum toxin has been gaining popularity as an intervention for UOS dysfunction, with some evidence to suggest that it is successful in improving swallow function. Despite a number of studies investigating its efficacy, there is a lack of consensus regarding whether this intervention is effective in improving swallowing for individuals with UOS dysfunction associated with neurological disease.Objectives: To establish the efficacy and safety of botulinum toxin use aimed at improving UOS dysfunction in people with swallowing difficulties (dysphagia) associated with non-progressive and progressive neurological disease.Search methods: We searched the following electronic databases for published trials: the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL); Ovid MEDLINE (1950 to 2013); EMBASE (1980 to 2013); AMED (Allied and Complementary Medicine) (1941 to 2013); CINAHL (Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature) (1937 to 2013). We also searched major clinical trials registers: CCT (http://www.controlled-trials.com); Clinical Trials (http://www.clinicaltrials.gov); Chinese Clinical Trial Register (www.chictr.org); ACTR (http://www.actr.org.au/. We examined the reference lists of all potentially relevant studies to identify further relevant trials. We handsearched published abstracts of conference proceedings from both the Dysphagia Research Society and the European Society of Swallowing Disorders. Digestive Disease Week (published in Gastroenterology) was also handsearched. Additionally, we searched ProQuest Dissertations & Theses for dissertation abstracts.Selection criteria: Only randomised controlled trials were sought.Data collection and analysis: Independent searches were completed by JR, AM, MC and MW. Two review authors (JR and MW) independently inspected titles, abstracts and key words identified from the literature search.Main results: No randomised controlled studies were retrieved. Twenty-nine studies were excluded, mainly on the basis of trial design.Authors' conclusions: It was not possible to reach a conclusion on the efficacy and safety of botulinum toxin as an intervention for people with UOS dysfunction and neurological disease. There is insufficient evidence to inform clinical practice.

Non-invasive alternatives (e.g. fluoride varnish, flossing) might avoid substance loss but their effectiveness depends on patients' adherence. Recently, micro-invasive approaches for treating proximal caries lesions have been tried. These interventions install a barrier either on top (sealing) or within (infiltrating) the lesion. Different methods and materials are currently available for micro-invasive treatments, such as sealing via resin sealants, (polyurethane) patches/tapes, glass ionomer cements (GIC) or resin infiltration.Objectives: To evaluate the effects of micro-invasive treatments for managing proximal caries lesions in primary and permanent dentition in children and adults.Search methods: We searched the following databases to 31 December 2014: the Cochrane Oral Health Group Trials Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE via OVID, EMBASE via OVID, LILACs via BIREME Virtual Health Library, Web of Science Conference Proceedings, ZETOC Conference Proceedings, Proquest Dissertations and Theses, ClinicalTrials.gov, OpenGrey and the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform. We searched the metaRegister of Controlled Trials to 1 October 2014. There were no language or date restrictions in the searches of the electronic databases.Selection criteria: We included randomised controlled trials of at least six months' duration that compared micro-invasive treatments for managing non-cavitated proximal dental decay in primary teeth, permanent teeth or both, versus non-invasive measures, invasive means, no intervention or placebo. We also included studies that compared different types of micro-invasive treatments.Data collection and analysis: Two review authors independently screened search results, extracted data and assessed the risk of bias. We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane to evaluate risk of bias and synthesise data. We conducted meta-analyses with the random-effects model, using the Becker-Balagtas method to calculate the odds ratio (OR) for lesion progression. We assessed the quality of the evidence using GRADE methods.Main results: We included eight trials, which randomised 365 participants. The trials all used a split-mouth design, some with more than one pair of lesions treated within the same participant. Studies took place in university or dental public health clinics in Brazil, Colombia, Denmark, Germany, Thailand, Greenland and Chile. Six studies evaluated the effects of micro-invasive treatments in the permanent dentition and two studies on the primary dentition, with caries risk ranging from low to high. Investigators measured caries risk in different studies either by caries experience alone or by using the Cariogram programme, which combines eight contributing factors, including caries experience, diet, saliva and other factors related to caries. The follow-up period in the trials ranged from one to three years. All studies used lesion progression as the primary outcome, evaluating it by different methods of reading radiographs. Four studies received industry support to carry out the research, with one of them being carried out by inventors of the intervention.We judged seven studies to be at high overall risk of bias, primarily due to lack of blinding of participants and personnel. We evaluated intervention effects for all micro-invasive therapies and analysed subgroups according to the different treatment methods reported in the included studies.Our meta-analysis, which pooled the most sensitive set of data (in terms of measurement method) from studies presenting data in a format suitable for meta-analysis, showed that micro-invasive treatment significantly reduced the odds of lesion progression compared with non-invasive treatment (e.g fluoride varnish) or oral hygiene advice (e.g to floss) (OR 0.24, 95% CI 0.14 to 0.41; 602 lesions; seven studies; I2 = 32%). There was no evidence of subgroup differences (P = 0.36).The four studies that measured adverse events reported no adverse events after micro-invasive treatment. Most studies did not report on any further outcomes.We assessed the quality of evidence for micro-invasive treatments as moderate. It remains unclear which micro-invasive treatment is more advantageous, or if certain clinical conditions or patient characteristics are better suited for micro-invasive treatments than others.Authors' conclusions: The available evidence shows that micro-invasive treatment of proximal caries lesions arrests non-cavitated enamel and initial dentinal lesions (limited to outer third of dentine, based on radiograph) and is significantly more effective than non-invasive professional treatment (e.g. fluoride varnish) or advice (e.g. to floss). We can be moderately confident that further research is unlikely to substantially change the estimate of effect. Due to the small number of studies, it does remain unclear which micro-invasive technique offers the greatest benefit, or whether the effects of micro-invasive treatment confer greater or lesser benefit according to different clinical or patient considerations.US: http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD010431.pub2/abstractRecord #229 of 271ID: CD007654AU: Siebenhofer AndreaAU: Jeitler KlausAU: Horvath KarlAU: Berghold AndreaAU: Posch NicoleAU: Meschik JuttaAU: Semlitsch ThomasTI: Long-term effects of weight-reducing drugs in people with hypertensionSO: Cochrane Database of Systematic ReviewsYR: 2016NO: 3PB: John Wiley & Sons, LtdKY: Weight Loss;Anti-Obesity Agents [adverse effects] [therapeutic use];Appetite Depressants [adverse effects] [therapeutic use];Blood Pressure [drug effects];Cyclobutanes [adverse effects] [therapeutic use];Diet, Reducing;Fructose [adverse effects] [analogs & derivatives] [therapeutic use];Hypertension [drug therapy] [mortality];Lactones [adverse effects] [therapeutic use];Phentermine [adverse effects] [therapeutic use];Piperidines [adverse effects] [therapeutic use];Pyrazoles [adverse effects] [therapeutic use];Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic;Safety-Based Drug Withdrawals;Time;Adult[checkword];Female[checkword];Humans[checkword];Male[checkword];Middle Aged[checkword]CC: HTNDOI: 10.1002/14651858.CD007654.pub4AB: Background: All major guidelines on antihypertensive therapy recommend weight loss; anti-obesity drugs may be able to help in this respect.Objectives: Primary objectives:To assess the long-term effects of pharmacologically induced reduction in body weight in adults with essential hypertension on all-cause mortality, cardiovascular morbidity, and adverse events (including total serious adverse events, withdrawal due to adverse events, and total non-serious adverse events).Secondary objectives:To assess the long-term effects of pharmacologically induced reduction in body weight in adults with essential hypertension on change from baseline in systolic blood pressure, change from baseline in diastolic blood pressure, and body weight reduction.Search methods: We obtained studies using computerised searches of the Cochrane Hypertension Group Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid EMBASE, the clinical trials registry ClinicalTrials.gov, and from handsearches in reference lists and systematic reviews (status as of 13 April 2015).Selection criteria: Randomised controlled trials in hypertensive adults of at least 24 weeks' duration that compared long-term pharmacologic interventions for weight loss with placebo. Data collection and analysis: Two review authors independently selected studies, assessed risk of bias, and extracted data. Where appropriate and in the absence of significant heterogeneity between studies (P > 0.1), we pooled studies using fixed-effect meta-analysis. When heterogeneity was present, we used the random-effects method and investigated the cause of heterogeneity.Main results: After updating the literature search, which was extended to include four new weight-reducing drugs, we identified one additional study of phentermine/topiramate, bringing the total number of studies to nine that compare orlistat, sibutramine, or phentermine/topiramate to placebo and thus fulfil our inclusion criteria. We identified no relevant studies investigating rimonabant, liraglutide, lorcaserin, or naltrexone/bupropion. No study included mortality and cardiovascular morbidity as predefined outcomes. Incidence of gastrointestinal side effects was consistently higher in those participants treated with orlistat versus those treated with placebo. The most frequent side effects were dry mouth, constipation, and headache with sibutramine, and dry mouth and paresthaesia with phentermine/topiramate. In participants assigned to orlistat, sibutramine, or phentermine/topiramate body weight was reduced more effectively than in participants in the usual-care/placebo groups. Orlistat reduced systolic blood pressure as compared to placebo by -2.5 mm Hg (mean difference (MD); 95% confidence interval (CI): -4.0 to -0.9 mm Hg) and diastolic blood pressure by -1.9 mm Hg (MD; 95% CI: -3.0 to -0.9 mm Hg). Sibutramine increased diastolic blood pressure compared to placebo by +3.2 mm Hg (MD; 95% CI: +1.4 to +4.9 mm Hg). The one trial that investigated phentermine/topiramate suggested it lowered blood pressure.Authors' conclusions: In people with elevated blood pressure, orlistat and sibutramine reduced body weight to a similar degree, while phentermine/topiramate reduced body weight to a greater extent. In the same trials, orlistat and phentermine/topiramate reduced blood pressure, while sibutramine increased it. We could include no trials investigating rimonabant, liraglutide, lorcaserin, or naltrexone/bupropion in people with elevated blood pressure. Long-term trials assessing the effect of orlistat, liraglutide, lorcaserin, phentermine/topiramate, or naltrexone/bupropion on mortality and morbidity are unavailable and needed. Rimonabant and sibutramine have been withdrawn from the market, after long-term trials on mortality and morbidity have confirmed concerns about the potential severe side effects of these two drugs. The European Medicines Agency refused marketing authorisation for phentermine/topiramate due to safety concerns, while the application for European marketing authorisation for lorcaserin was withdrawn by the manufacturer after the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use judged the overall benefit/risk balance to be negative.US: http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD007654.pub4/abstractRecord #230 of 271ID: CD009059AU: Liu Zhao LanAU: Xie Liang ZhenAU: Zhu JiangAU: Li George QAU: Grant Suzanne JAU: Liu Jian PingTI: Herbal medicines for fatty liver diseasesSO: Cochrane Database of Systematic ReviewsYR: 2013NO: 8PB: John Wiley & Sons, LtdKY: Plants, Medicinal;Drugs, Chinese Herbal [therapeutic use];Fatty Liver [drug therapy];Non-alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease;Phytotherapy [methods];Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic;Humans[checkword]CC: LIVERDOI: 10.1002/14651858.CD009059.pub2AB: Background: Fatty liver disease is potentially a reversible condition that may lead to end-stage liver disease. Since herbal medicines such as Crataegus pinnatifida and Salvia miltiorrhiza have increasingly been used in the management of fatty liver disease, a systematic review on herbal medicine for fatty liver disease is needed.Objectives: To assess the beneficial and harmful effects of herbal medicines for people with alcoholic or non-alcoholic fatty liver disease.Search methods: We searched The Cochrane Hepato-Biliary Group Controlled Trials Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (Issue 3, 2012), MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Science Citation Index Expanded to 1 March 2012. We also searched the Chinese BioMedical Database, Traditional Chinese Medical Literature Analysis and Retrieval System, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, Chinese VIP Information, Chinese Academic Conference Papers Database and Chinese Dissertation Database, and the Allied and Complementary Medicine Database to 2 March 2012.Selection criteria: We included randomised clinical trials comparing herbal medicines with placebo, no treatment, a pharmacological intervention, or a non-pharmacological intervention such as diet or lifestyle, or Western interventions in participants with fatty liver disease.Data collection and analysis: Two review authors extracted data independently. We used the 'risk of bias' tool to assess the risk of bias of the included trials. We assessed the following domains: random sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding, incomplete outcome data, selective outcome reporting, and other sources of bias. We presented the effects estimates as risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) or as mean differences (MD) with 95% CI, depending on the variables of the outcome measures.Main results: We included 77 randomised clinical trials, which included 6753 participants with fatty liver disease. The risks of bias (overestimation of benefits and underestimation of harms) was high in all trials. The mean sample size was 88 participants (ranging from 40 to 200 participants) per trial. Seventy-five different herbal medicine products were tested. Herbal medicines tested in the randomised trials included single-herb products (Gynostemma pentaphyllum, Panax notoginseng, andPrunus armeniaca), proprietary herbal medicines commercially available, and combination formulas prescribed by practitioners. The most commonly used herbs wereCrataegus pinnatifida,Salvia miltiorrhiza,Alisma orientalis,Bupleurum chinense,Cassia obtusifolia, Astragalus membranaceous, and Rheum palmatum. None of the trials reported death, hepatic-related morbidity, quality of life, or costs. A large number of trials reported positive effects on putative surrogate outcomes such as serum aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, glutamyltransferase, alkaline phosphatases, ultrasound, and computed tomography scan. Twenty-seven trials reported adverse effects and found no significant difference between herbal medicines versus control. However, the risk of bias of the included trials was high.The outcomes were ultrasound findings in 22 trials, liver computed tomography findings in eight trials, aspartate aminotransferase levels in 64 trials, alanine aminotransferase activity in 77 trials, and glutamyltransferase activities in 44 trials. Six herbal medicines showed statistically significant beneficial effects on ultrasound, four on liver computed tomography, 42 on aspartate aminotransferase activity, 49 on alanine aminotransferase activity, three on alkaline phosphatases activity, and 32 on glutamyltransferase activity compared with control interventions.Authors' conclusions: Some herbal medicines seemed to have positive effects on aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, ultrasound, and computed tomography. We found no significant difference on adverse effects between herbal medicine and control groups. The findings are not conclusive due to the high risk of bias of the included trials and the limited number of trials testing individual herbal medicines. Accordingly, there is also high risk of random errors.US: http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD009059.pub2/abstractRecord #231 of 271ID: CD009021AU: Han ShanshanAU: Middleton PhilippaAU: Crowther Caroline ATI: Exercise for pregnant women for preventing gestational diabetes mellitusSO: Cochrane Database of Systematic ReviewsYR: 2012NO: 7PB: John Wiley & Sons, LtdKY: Birth Weight;Cesarean Section [utilization];Diabetes, Gestational [epidemiology] [prevention & control];Exercise [physiology];Hyperglycemia [epidemiology];Incidence;Insulin Resistance [physiology];Pre-Eclampsia [epidemiology];Prenatal Care;Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic;Female[checkword];Humans[checkword];Infant, Newborn[checkword];Pregnancy[checkword]CC: PREGDOI: 10.1002/14651858.CD009021.pub2AB: Background: Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) affects a significant number of women each year. GDM is associated with a wide range of adverse outcomes for women and their babies. Recent observational studies have found physical activity during normal pregnancy decreases insulin resistance and therefore might help to decrease the risk of developing GDM.Objectives: To assess the effects of physical exercise for pregnant women for preventing glucose intolerance or GDM.Search methods: We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group’s Trials Register (2 April 2012), ClinicalTrials.gov (2 April 2012) and the WOMBAT Perinatal Trials Registry (2 April 2012).Selection criteria: Randomised and cluster-randomised trials assessing the effects of exercise for preventing pregnancy glucose intolerance or GDM.Data collection and analysis: Two review authors independently assessed study eligibility, extracted data and assessed the risk of bias of included studies.Main results: We included five trials with a total of 1115 women and their babies (922 women and their babies contributed outcome data). Four of the five included trials had small sample sizes with one large trial that recruited 855 women and babies. All five included trials had a moderate risk of bias. When comparing women receiving additional exercise interventions with those having routine antenatal care, there was no significant difference in GDM incidence (three trials, 826 women, risk ratio (RR) 1.10, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.66 to 1.84), caesarean section (two trials, 934 women, RR 1.33, 95% CI 0.97 to 1.84) or operative vaginal birth (two trials, 934 women, RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.58 to 1.17). No trial reported the infant primary outcomes prespecified in the review.None of the five included trials found significant differences in insulin sensitivity. Evidence from one single large trial suggested no significant difference in the incidence of developing pregnancy hyperglycaemia not meeting GDM diagnostic criteria, pre-eclampsia or admission to neonatal ward between the two study groups. Babies born to women receiving exercise interventions had a non-significant trend to a lower ponderal index (mean difference (MD) -0.08 gram x 100 m3, 95% CI -0.18 to 0.02, one trial, 84 infants). No significant differences were seen between the two study groups for the outcomes of birthweight (two trials, 167 infants, MD -102.87 grams, 95% CI -235.34 to 29.60), macrosomia (two trials, 934 infants, RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.68 to 1.22), or small-for-gestational age (one trial, 84 infants, RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.25 to 4.40) or gestational age at birth (two trials, 167 infants, MD -0.04 weeks, 95% CI -0.37 to 0.29) or Apgar score less than seven at five minutes (two trials, 919 infants, RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.27 to 3.65). None of the trials reported long-term outcomes for women and their babies. No information was available on health services costs.Authors' conclusions: There is limited randomised controlled trial evidence available on the effect of exercise during pregnancy for preventing pregnancy glucose intolerance or GDM. Results from three randomised trials with moderate risk of bias suggested no significant difference in GDM incidence between women receiving an additional exercise intervention and routine care.Based on the limited data currently available, conclusive evidence is not available to guide practice. Larger, well-designed randomised trials, with standardised behavioural interventions are needed to assess the effects of exercise on preventing GDM and other adverse pregnancy outcomes including large-for-gestational age and perinatal mortality. Longer-term health outcomes for both women and their babies and health service costs should be included. Several such trials are in progress. We identified another seven trials which are ongoing and we will consider these for inclusion in the next update of this review.US: http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD009021.pub2/abstractRecord #232 of 271ID: CD004823AU: Chang Anne BAU: Lasserson Toby JAU: Gaffney JustinAU: Connor Frances LAU: Garske Luke ATI: Gastro-oesophageal reflux treatment for prolonged non-specific cough in children and adultsSO: Cochrane Database of Systematic ReviewsYR: 2011NO: 1PB: John Wiley & Sons, LtdKY: Age Factors;Chronic Disease;Cough [etiology] [therapy];Gastroesophageal Reflux [complications] [therapy];Histamine H2 Antagonists [therapeutic use];Proton Pump Inhibitors [therapeutic use];Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic;Adult[checkword];Child[checkword];Humans[checkword]CC: AIRWAYSDOI: 10.1002/14651858.CD004823.pub4AB: Background: Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GORD) is said to be the causative factor in up to 41% of adults with chronic cough. Treatment for GORD includes conservative measures (diet manipulation), pharmaceutical therapy (motility or prokinetic agents, H2-antagonist and proton pump inhibitors (PPI)) and fundoplication.Objectives: To evaluate the efficacy of GORD treatment on chronic cough in children and adults with GORD and prolonged cough that is not related to an underlying respiratory disease, i.e. non-specific chronic cough.Search methods: We searched the Cochrane Airways Group Specialised Register, the Cochrane Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, review articles and reference lists of relevant articles. The date of last search was 8 April 2010.Selection criteria: All randomised controlled trials (RCTs) on GORD treatment for cough in children and adults without primary lung disease.Data collection and analysis: Two review authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. We contacted study authors for further information.Main results: We included 19 studies (six paediatric, 13 adults). None of the paediatric studies could be combined for meta-analysis. A single RCT in infants found that PPI (compared to placebo) was not efficacious for cough outcomes (favouring placebo OR 1.61; 95% CI 0.57 to 4.55) but those on PPI had significantly increased adverse events (OR 5.56; 95% CI 1.18 to 26.25) (number needed to treat for harm in four weeks was 11 (95% CI 3 to 232)). In adults, analysis of H2 antagonist, motility agents and conservative treatment for GORD was not possible (lack of data) and there were no controlled studies of fundoplication. We analysed nine adult studies comparing PPI (two to three months) to placebo for various outcomes in the meta-analysis. Using intention-to-treat, pooled data from studies resulted in no significant difference between treatment and placebo in total resolution of cough (OR 0.46; 95% CI 0.19 to 1.15). Pooled data revealed no overall significant improvement in cough outcomes (end of trial or change in cough scores). We only found significant differences in sensitivity analyses. We found a significant improvement in change of cough scores at end of intervention (two to three months) in those receiving PPI (standardised mean difference -0.41; 95% CI -0.75 to -0.07) using generic inverse variance analysis on cross-over trials. Two studies reported improvement in cough after five days to two weeks of treatment.Authors' conclusions: PPI is not efficacious for cough associated with GORD symptoms in very young children (including infants) and should not be used for cough outcomes. There is insufficient data in older children to draw any valid conclusions. In adults, there is insufficient evidence to conclude definitely that GORD treatment with PPI is universally beneficial for cough associated with GORD. Clinicians should be cognisant of the period (natural resolution with time) and placebo effect in studies that utilise cough as an outcome measure. Future paediatric and adult studies should be double-blind, randomised controlled and parallel-design, using treatments for at least two months, with validated subjective and objective cough outcomes and include ascertainment of time to respond as well as assessment of acid and/or non-acid reflux.US: http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD004823.pub4/abstractRecord #233 of 271ID: CD009402AU: Garrison Scott RAU: Allan G MichaelAU: Sekhon Ravneet KAU: Musini Vijaya MAU: Khan Karim MTI: Magnesium for skeletal muscle crampsSO: Cochrane Database of Systematic ReviewsYR: 2012NO: 9PB: John Wiley & Sons, LtdKY: Muscle, Skeletal;Age Factors;Cross-Over Studies;Magnesium [therapeutic use];Muscle Cramp [drug therapy] [etiology];Pregnancy Complications [drug therapy];Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic;Female[checkword];Humans[checkword];Male[checkword];Pregnancy[checkword]CC: NEUROMUSCDOI: 10.1002/14651858.CD009402.pub2AB: Background: Skeletal muscle cramps are common and often presented to physicians in association with pregnancy, advanced age, exercise or disorders of the motor neuron (such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis). Magnesium supplements are marketed for the prophylaxis of cramps but the efficacy of magnesium for this indication has never been evaluated by systematic review.Objectives: To assess the effects of magnesium supplementation compared to no treatment, placebo control or other cramp therapies in people with skeletal muscle cramps.  Search methods: We searched the Cochrane Neuromuscular Disease Group Specialized Register (11 October 2011), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (2011, Issue 3), MEDLINE (January 1966 to September 2011), EMBASE (January 1980 to September 2011), LILACS (January 1982 to September 2011), CINAHL Plus (January 1937 to September 2011), AMED (January 1985 to October 2011) and SPORTDiscus (January 1975 to September 2011).Selection criteria: Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of magnesium supplementation (in any form) to prevent skeletal muscle cramps in any patient group (i.e. all clinical presentations of cramp). We considered comparisons of magnesium with no treatment, placebo control, or other therapy.Data collection and analysis: Two authors independently selected trials for inclusion and extracted data. Two authors assessed risk of bias. We attempted to contact all study authors and obtained patient level data for three of the included trials, one of which was unpublished. All data on adverse effects were collected from the included RCTs.Main results: We identified seven trials (five parallel, two cross-over) enrolling a total of 406 individuals amongst whom 118 cross-over participants additionally served as their own controls. Three trials enrolled women with pregnancy-associated leg cramps (N = 202) and four trials enrolled idiopathic cramp sufferers (N = 322 including cross-over controls). Magnesium was compared to placebo in six trials and to no treatment in one trial.For idiopathic cramps (largely older adults presumed to have nocturnal leg cramps), differences in measures of cramp frequency, magnesium versus placebo, were small, not statistically significant, and without heterogeneity (I2 = 0%). This includes the primary endpoint, percentage change from baseline in the number of cramps per week at four weeks (-3.93%, 95% confidence interval (CI) -21.12% to 13.26%, moderate quality evidence) and the difference in the number of cramps per week at four weeks (0.01 cramps/week, 95% CI -0.52 to 0.55, moderate quality evidence). The percentage of individuals experiencing a 25% or better reduction in cramp rate from baseline was also no different, being 8% lower in the magnesium group (95% CI -28% to 12%, moderate quality evidence). Similarly, no statistically significant difference was found at four weeks in measures of cramp intensity (moderate quality evidence) or cramp duration (low quality evidence).Meta-analysis was not possible for trials of pregnancy-associated leg cramps. The single study comparing magnesium to no treatment failed to find statistically significant benefit on a three-point ordinal scale of overall treatment efficacy. The two trials comparing magnesium to placebo differed in that one trial found no benefit on frequency or intensity measures while the other found benefit for both.Withdrawals due to adverse events were not significantly different than placebo. While we could not determine the number of subjects with minor adverse events, studies of oral magnesium generally described potential side effects as similar in frequency to placebo.Authors' conclusions: It is unlikely that magnesium supplementation provides clinically meaningful cramp prophylaxis to older adults experiencing skeletal muscle cramps. In contrast, for those experiencing pregnancy-associated rest cramps the literature is conflicting and further research in this patient population is needed. We found no randomized controlled trials evaluating magnesium for exercise-associated muscle cramps or disease state-associated muscle cramps (for example amyotrophic lateral sclerosis/motor neuron disease).US: http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD009402.pub2/abstractRecord #234 of 271ID: CD009884AU: Billson Hazel AAU: Holland CathrineAU: Curwell JanetAU: Davey Valerie LAU: Kinsey LauraAU: Lawton Lianna JAU: Whitworth Alison JAU: Burden SorrelTI: Perioperative nutrition interventions for women with ovarian cancerSO: Cochrane Database of Systematic ReviewsYR: 2013NO: 9PB: John Wiley & Sons, LtdKY: Food;Elective Surgical Procedures;Fluid Therapy [methods];Malnutrition [diet therapy] [etiology];Ovarian Neoplasms [complications] [surgery];Perioperative Care [methods];Postoperative Nausea and Vomiting [epidemiology];Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic;Adult[checkword];Female[checkword];Humans[checkword]CC: GYNAECADOI: 10.1002/14651858.CD009884.pub2AB: Background: Women with ovarian cancer have been shown to be at significant risk of malnutrition with incidence rates described as being between 28% to 67%. Nutrition interventions may improve clinical outcomes positively, nutritional status or quality of life measures in this patient group.Objectives: This review was conducted to assess the effects of nutrition interventions during the perioperative period for women with ovarian cancer.Search methods: Electronic searches were conducted of the Cochrane Gynaecological Cancer Group Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL 2012, Issue 7), Medline (1946 to July week 4 2012), Embase (1980 to 2012 week 31), DARE (to 7th August 2012) AMED (1985 to April 2012), BNI (1992 to April 2012), CINAHL (to April 2012). We also searched trials databases, conference proceedings and related citation lists. Reference listings were handsearched. No restrictions were applied on language or date.Selection criteria: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in which women 18 years and over with any stage of ovarian cancer, including recurrent cancer, were in the perioperative phase of treatment and received any type of nutrition intervention.Data collection and analysis: Titles and abstracts were screened by two review authors with study selection discussed by a team. Pairs of review authors worked independently on data collection and compared findings.Main results: A total of 4092 titles were screened and 14 full text reports reviewed; a single small study met the inclusion criteria. In the included RCT, 40 women (35 with ovarian cancer) had extensive elective surgery including bowel resection for treatment of gynaecological malignancy. Randomisation was made to either early oral feeding (oral fluids in the first 24 hours, solid foods on the following day) or to a 'traditional' feeding regimen where oral fluids and foods were delayed until there was evidence of bowel function. Most women in the early feeding group (14/18) were able to resume eating solid food one day after surgery. This resulted in a significantly shorter hospital stay with no increase in postoperative complications or change in quality of life measures in comparison with the women on the 'traditional' feeding regimen. The incidence of nausea and vomiting during the postoperative stay was similar in both groups and was noted in slightly more than half of the women. Overall survival was evaluated until 30 days following discharge from hospital; in this period, there was one death of a woman who had been in the 'traditional oral feeding' group, cause of death was not noted. We assessed risk of bias and found no high risk of bias was identified in the methodology and reporting of the included study, although there was an increased risk of bias due to the small size of the study in which not all of the women had ovarian cancer.Authors' conclusions: Although women with ovarian cancer have been shown to be at risk of malnutrition, there is a lack of evidence derived from RCTs evaluating the identification, assessment and treatment of malnutrition during the perioperative phase of treatment. There is evidence from one small study that some women with ovarian cancer undergoing surgery with associated bowel resection may safely commence oral fluids within 24 hours of surgery and solid foods on the following day. Further research is required, including a RCT, to generate guidance concerning the treatment of malnutrition in this patient group.US: http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD009884.pub2/abstractRecord #235 of 271ID: CD007543AU: Callaghan Brian CAU: Little Ann AAU: Feldman Eva LAU: Hughes Richard ACTI: Enhanced glucose control for preventing and treating diabetic neuropathySO: Cochrane Database of Systematic ReviewsYR: 2012NO: 6PB: John Wiley & Sons, LtdKY: Diabetes Mellitus, Type 1 [complications];Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2 [complications];Diabetic Neuropathies [prevention & control];Hyperglycemia [prevention & control];Hypoglycemic Agents [therapeutic use];Insulin [therapeutic use];Humans[checkword]CC: NEUROMUSCDOI: 10.1002/14651858.CD007543.pub2AB: Background: There are two types of diabetes. Type 1 diabetes affects younger people and needs treatment with insulin injections. Type 2 diabetes affects older people and can usually be treated by diet and oral drugs. Diabetic neuropathy affects 10% of patients with diabetes mellitus at diagnosis and 40% to 50% after 10 years. Enhanced glucose control is the best studied intervention for the prevention of this disabling condition but there have been no systematic reviews of the evidence.Objectives: To examine the evidence for enhanced glucose control in the prevention of distal symmetric polyneuropathy in people with type 1 and type 2 diabetes.Search methods: We searched the Cochrane Neuromuscular Disease Group Specialized Register (30 January 2012), CENTRAL (2012, Issue 1), MEDLINE (1966 to January 2012) and EMBASE (1980 to January 2012) for randomized controlled trials of enhanced glucose control in diabetes mellitus.Selection criteria: We included all randomized, controlled studies investigating enhanced glycemic control that reported neuropathy outcomes after at least one year of intervention. Our primary outcome measure was annual development of clinical neuropathy defined by a clinical scale. Secondary outcomes included motor nerve conduction velocity and quantitative vibration testing. Data collection and analysis: Two authors independently reviewed all titles and abstracts identified by the database searches for inclusion. Two authors abstracted data from all included studies with a standardized form. A third author mediated conflicts. We analyzed the presence of clinical neuropathy with annualized risk differences (RDs), and conduction velocity and quantitative velocity measurements with mean differences per year. Main results: This review identified 17 randomized studies that addressed whether enhanced glucose control prevents the development of neuropathy. Seven of these studies were conducted in people with type 1 diabetes, eight in type 2 diabetes, and two in both types. A meta-analysis of the two studies that reported the primary outcome (incidence of clinical neuropathy) with a total of 1228 participants with type 1 diabetes revealed a significantly reduced risk of developing clinical neuropathy in those with enhanced glucose control, an annualized RD of -1.84% (95% confidence interval (CI) -1.11 to -2.56). In a similar analysis of four studies that reported the primary outcome, involving 6669 participants with type 2 diabetes, the annualized RD of developing clinical neuropathy was -0.58% (95% CI 0.01 to -1.17). Most secondary outcomes were significantly in favor of intensive treatment in both populations. However, both types of diabetic participants also had a significant increase in severe adverse events including hypoglycemic events.Authors' conclusions: According to high-quality evidence, enhanced glucose control significantly prevents the development of clinical neuropathy and reduces nerve conduction and vibration threshold abnormalities in type 1 diabetes mellitus. In type 2 diabetes mellitus, enhanced glucose control reduces the incidence of clinical neuropathy, although this was not formally statistically significant (P = 0.06). However, enhanced glucose control does significantly reduce nerve conduction and vibration threshold abnormalities. Importantly, enhanced glucose control significantly increases the risk of severe hypoglycemic episodes, which needs to be taken into account when evaluating its risk/benefit ratio.US: http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD007543.pub2/abstractRecord #236 of 271ID: CD009934AU: Hartley LouiseAU: Flowers NadineAU: Holmes JenniferAU: Clarke AileenAU: Stranges SaverioAU: Hooper LeeAU: Rees KarenTI: Green and black tea for the primary prevention of cardiovascular diseaseSO: Cochrane Database of Systematic ReviewsYR: 2013NO: 6PB: John Wiley & Sons, LtdKY: Beverages;Camellia sinensis;Blood Pressure [physiology];Cardiovascular Diseases [prevention & control];Cholesterol [blood];Phytotherapy [methods];Primary Prevention [methods];Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic;Tea;Humans[checkword]CC: VASCDOI: 10.1002/14651858.CD009934.pub2AB: Background: There is increasing evidence that both green and black tea are beneficial for cardiovascular disease (CVD) prevention.Objectives: To determine the effects of green and black tea on the primary prevention of CVD.Search methods: We searched the following databases on 12 October 2012 without language restrictions: CENTRAL in The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE (OVID), EMBASE (OVID) and Web of Science (Thomson Reuters). We also searched trial registers, screened reference lists and contacted authors for additional information where necessary.Selection criteria: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) lasting at least three months involving healthy adults or those at high risk of CVD. Trials investigated the intake of green tea, black tea or tea extracts. The comparison group was no intervention, placebo or minimal intervention. The outcomes of interest were CVD clinical events and major CVD risk factors. Any trials involving multifactorial lifestyle interventions or focusing on weight loss were excluded to avoid confounding.Data collection and analysis: Two review authors independently selected trials for inclusion, abstracted data and assessed the risk of bias. Trials of green tea were analysed separately from trials of black tea.Main results: We identified 11 RCTs with a total of 821 participants, two trials awaiting classification and one ongoing trial. Seven trials examined a green tea intervention and four examined a black tea intervention. Dosage and form of both green and black tea differed between trials. The ongoing trial is examining the effects of green tea powder capsules.No studies reported cardiovascular events.Black tea was found to produce statistically significant reductions in low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol (mean difference (MD) -0.43 mmol/L, 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.56 to -0.31) and blood pressure (systolic blood pressure (SBP): MD -1.85 mmHg, 95% CI -3.21 to -0.48. Diastolic blood pressure (DBP): MD -1.27 mmHg, 95% CI -3.06 to 0.53) over six months, stable to sensitivity analysis, but only a small number of trials contributed to each analysis and studies were at risk of bias.Green tea was also found to produce statistically significant reductions in total cholesterol (MD -0.62 mmol/L, 95% CI -0.77 to -0.46), LDL cholesterol (MD -0.64 mmol/L, 95% CI -0.77 to -0.52) and blood pressure (SBP: MD -3.18 mmHg, 95% CI -5.25 to -1.11; DBP: MD -3.42, 95% CI -4.54 to -2.30), but only a small number of studies contributed to each analysis, and results were not stable to sensitivity analysis. When both tea types were analysed together they showed favourable effects on LDL cholesterol (MD -0.48 mmol/L, 95% CI -0.61 to -0.35) and blood pressure (SBP: MD -2.25 mmHg, 95% CI -3.39 to -1.11; DBP: MD -2.81 mmHg, 95% CI -3.77 to -1.86). Adverse events were measured in five trials and included a diagnosis of prostate cancer, hospitalisation for influenza, appendicitis and retinal detachment but these are unlikely to be directly attributable to the intervention.Authors' conclusions: There are very few long-term studies to date examining green or black tea for the primary prevention of CVD. The limited evidence suggests that tea has favourable effects on CVD risk factors, but due to the small number of trials contributing to each analysis the results should be treated with some caution and further high quality trials with longer-term follow-up are needed to confirm this.US: http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD009934.pub2/abstractRecord #237 of 271ID: CD006027AU: Afshar KouroshAU: Jafari SiavashAU: Marks Andrew JAU: Eftekhari ArashAU: MacNeily Andrew ETI: Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and non-opioids for acute renal colicSO: Cochrane Database of Systematic ReviewsYR: 2015NO: 6PB: John Wiley & Sons, LtdKY: Acute Disease;Analgesics, Non-Narcotic [therapeutic use];Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal [therapeutic use];Diclofenac [therapeutic use];Indomethacin [therapeutic use];Parasympatholytics [therapeutic use];Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic;Renal Colic [drug therapy];Scopolamine Hydrobromide [therapeutic use];Humans[checkword]CC: RENALDOI: 10.1002/14651858.CD006027.pub2AB: Background: Renal colic is acute pain caused by urinary stones. The prevalence of urinary stones is between 10% and 15% in the United States, making renal colic one of the common reasons for urgent urological care. The pain is usually severe and the first step in the management is adequate analgesia. Many different classes of medications have been used in this regard including non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and narcotics.Objectives: The aim of this review was to assess benefits and harms of different NSAIDs and non-opioids in the treatment of adult patients with acute renal colic and if possible to determine which medication (or class of medications) are more appropriate for this purpose. Clinically relevant outcomes such as efficacy of pain relief, time to pain relief, recurrence of pain, need for rescue medication and side effects were explored.Search methods: We searched the Cochrane Renal Group's Specialised Register (to 27 November 2014) through contact with the Trials' Search Co-ordinator using search terms relevant to this review.Selection criteria: Only randomised or quasi randomised studies were included. Other inclusion criteria included adult patients with a clinical diagnosis of renal colic due to urolithiasis, at least one treatment arm included a non-narcotic analgesic compared to placebo or another non-narcotic drug, and reporting of pain outcome or medication adverse effect. Patient-rated pain by a validated tool, time to relief, need for rescue medication and pain recurrence constituted the outcomes of interest. Any adverse effects (minor or major) reported in the studies were included.Data collection and analysis: Abstracts were reviewed by at least two authors independently. Papers meeting the inclusion criteria were fully reviewed and relevant data were recorded in a standardized Cochrane Renal Group data collection form. For dichotomous outcomes relative risks and 95% confidence intervals were calculated. For continuous outcomes the weighted mean difference was estimated. Both fixed and random models were used for meta-analysis. We assessed the analgesic effects using four different outcome variables: patient-reported pain relief using a visual analogue scale (VAS); proportion of patients with at least 50% reduction in pain; need for rescue medication; and pain recurrence. Heterogeneity was assessed using the I² test.Main results: A total of 50 studies (5734 participants) were included in this review and 37 studies (4483 participants) contributed to our meta-analyses. Selection bias was low in 34% of the studies or unclear in 66%; performance bias was low in 74%, high in 14% and unclear in 12%; attrition bias was low in 82% and high in 18%; selective reporting bias low in 92% of the studies; and other biases (industry funding) was high in 4%, unclear in 18% and low in 78%.Patient-reported pain (VAS) results varied widely with high heterogeneity observed. For those comparisons which could be pooled we observed the following: NSAIDs significantly reduced pain compared to antispasmodics (5 studies, 303 participants: MD -12.97, 95% CI -21.80 to - 4.14; I² = 74%) and combination therapy of NSAIDs plus antispasmodics was significantly more effective in pain control than NSAID alone (2 studies, 310 participants: MD -1.99, 95% CI -2.58 to -1.40; I² = 0%).NSAIDs were significantly more effective than placebo in reducing pain by 50% within the first hour (3 studies, 197 participants: RR 2.28, 95% CI 1.47 to 3.51; I² = 15%). Indomethacin was found to be less effective than other NSAIDs (4 studies, 412 participants: RR 1.27, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.60; I² = 55%). NSAIDs were significantly more effective than hyoscine in pain reduction (5 comparisons, 196 participants: RR 2.44, 95% CI 1.61 to 3.70; I² = 28%). The combination of NSAIDs and antispasmodics was not superior to NSAIDs only (9 comparisons, 906 participants: RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.89 to 1.13; I² = 59%). The results were mixed when NSAIDs were compared to other non-opioid medications.When the need for rescue medication was evaluated, Patients receiving NSAIDs were significantly less likely to require rescue medicine than those receiving placebo (4 comparisons, 180 participants: RR 0.35, 95% CI 0.20 to 0.60; I² = 24%) and NSAIDs were more effective than antispasmodics (4 studies, 299 participants: RR 0.34, 95% CI 0.14 to 0.84; I² = 65%). Combination of NSAIDs and antispasmodics was not superior to NSAIDs (7 comparisons, 589 participants: RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.62 to 1.57; I² = 10%). Indomethacin was less effective than other NSAIDs (4 studies, 517 participants: RR 1.36, 95% CI 0.96 to 1.94; I² = 14%) except for lysine acetyl salicylate (RR 0.15, 95% CI 0.04 to 0.65).Pain recurrence was reported by only three studies which could not be pooled: a higher proportion of patients treated with 75 mg diclofenac (IM) showed pain recurrence in the first 24 hours of follow-up compared to those treated with 40 mg piroxicam (IM) (60 participants: RR 0.05, 95% CI 0.00 to 0.81); no significant difference in pain recurrence at 72 hours was observed between piroxicam plus phloroglucinol and piroxicam plus placebo groups (253 participants: RR 2.52, 95% CI 0.15 to12.75); and there was no significant difference in pain recurrence within 72 hours of discharge between IM piroxicam and IV paracetamol (82 participants: RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.65 to 1.54).Side effects were presented inconsistently, but no major events were reported.Authors' conclusions: Although due to variability in studies (inclusion criteria, outcome variables and interventions) and the evidence is not of highest quality, we still believe that NSAIDs are an effective treatment for renal colic when compared to placebo or antispasmodics. The addition of antispasmodics to NSAIDS does not result in better pain control. Data on other types of non-opioid, non-NSAID medication was scarce.Major adverse effects are not reported in the literature for the use of NSAIDs for treatment of renal colic.US: http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD006027.pub2/abstractRecord #238 of 271ID: CD010037AU: Cormick GabrielaAU: Ciapponi AgustínAU: Cafferata María LuisaAU: Belizán José MTI: Calcium supplementation for prevention of primary hypertensionSO: Cochrane Database of Systematic ReviewsYR: 2015NO: 6PB: John Wiley & Sons, LtdKY: Dietary Supplements;Age Factors;Calcium, Dietary [administration & dosage];Diastole;Hypertension [prevention & control];Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic;Sex Factors;Systole;Adult[checkword];Female[checkword];Humans[checkword];Male[checkword];Middle Aged[checkword]CC: HTNDOI: 10.1002/14651858.CD010037.pub2AB: Background: Hypertension is a major public health problem that increases the risk of cardiovascular and kidney diseases. Several studies have shown an inverse association between calcium intake and blood pressure. As small reductions in blood pressure have been shown to produce rapid reductions in vascular disease risk even in individuals with normal blood pressure ranges, this review intends to evaluate the effect of calcium supplementation in normotensive individuals as a preventive health measure.Objectives: To assess the efficacy and safety of calcium supplementation versus placebo or control for reducing blood pressure in normotensive people.Search methods: We searched the Cochrane Hypertension Group Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, MEDLINE In-Process, EMBASE and ClinicalTrials.gov for randomised controlled trials up to October 2014. The WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) is searched for inclusion in the Group's Specialised Register. We also reviewed reference lists from retrieved studies and contacted authors of relevant papers. We applied no language restrictions.Selection criteria: We selected trials that randomised normotensive people to dietary calcium interventions such as supplementation or food fortification versus placebo or control. We excluded quasi-random designs. The primary outcomes were hypertension (defined as blood pressure ≥ 140/90 mmHg) and blood pressure measures.Data collection and analysis: Two review authors independently selected trials for inclusion, abstracted the data and assessed the risks of bias.Main results: We included 16 trials with 3048 participants. None of the studies reported hypertension as a dichotomous outcome. The effect on systolic and diastolic blood pressure was mean difference (MD) -1.43 mmHg (95% confidence interval (CI) -2.15 to -0.72) and -0.98 mmHg (95%CI -1.46 to -0.50) respectively. The effect on systolic and diastolic blood pressure for those younger than 35 years (7 trials with 399 participants) was -2.11 mmHg (95%CI -3.58 to -0.64) / -2.61 mmHg (95% CI -3.74, -1.49). The effect on systolic and diastolic blood pressure for those 35 years or more (9 trials with 2649 participants) was -0.96 mmHg (95%CI -1.83 to -0.09) / -0.59 mmHg (95%CI -1.13 to -0.06). The effect on systolic and diastolic blood pressure for women (6 trials with 1823 participants) was -1.45 mmHg (95% CI -2.78 to -0.12) / -0.92 mmHg (95% CI -1.71 to -0.14). The effect on systolic and diastolic blood pressure for men (5 trials with 617 participants) was -2.07 (95%CI -3.56 to -0.59] / -1.91 (95%CI -2.80 to -1.02).The quality of evidence for each of these outcomes was high. The effect is consistent in both genders regardless of baseline calcium intake.The effect on systolic blood pressure was 0.08 mmHg (95% CI -2.16 to 2.32) with doses less than 1000 mg, -1.14 mmHg (95% CI -2.01 to -0.27) with 1000 - 1500 mg, and -2.79 mmHg (95% CI -4.71 to -0.86) with more than 1500 mg. The effect on diastolic blood pressure was -0.54 mmHg (95% CI -2.23 to 1.15), -0.71 mmHg (95% CI -1.37 to -0.06) and -1.43 mmHg (95% CI -2.22 to -0.64) respectively. The quality of evidence for each of these outcomes was high.None of the studies reported adverse events.Authors' conclusions: An increase in calcium intake slightly reduces both systolic and diastolic blood pressure in normotensive people, particularly in young people, suggesting a role in the prevention of hypertension. These results should be interpreted with caution, since the proposed biological mechanism explaining the relationship between calcium and blood pressure has not been fully confirmed. The effect across multiple prespecified subgroups and a possible dose response effect reinforce this conclusion. Even small reductions in blood pressure could have important health implications for reducing vascular disease.There is a great need for adequately-powered clinical trials randomising young people. Subgroup analysis should involve basal calcium intake, age, sex, basal blood pressure, and body mass index. We also require assessment of side effects, optimal doses and the best strategy to improve calcium intake.US: http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD010037.pub2/abstractRecord #239 of 271ID: CD002300AU: MacLennan SuzannaAU: Augood CristinaAU: Cash-Gibson LucindaAU: Logan StuartAU: Gilbert Ruth ETI: Cisapride treatment for gastro-oesophageal reflux in childrenSO: Cochrane Database of Systematic ReviewsYR: 2010NO: 4PB: John Wiley & Sons, LtdKY: Anti-Ulcer Agents [adverse effects] [therapeutic use];Cisapride [adverse effects] [therapeutic use];Gastroesophageal Reflux [drug therapy];Gastrointestinal Agents [adverse effects] [therapeutic use];Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic;Humans[checkword];Infant[checkword];Infant, Newborn[checkword]CC: UPPERGIDOI: 10.1002/14651858.CD002300.pub2AB: Background: Gastro-oesophageal reflux (GOR) is common and usually self-limiting in infants. Cisapride, a pro-kinetic agent, was commonly prescribed until reports of possible serious adverse events were associated with its use.Objectives: To determine the effectiveness of cisapride versus placebo or non-surgical treatments for symptoms of GOR.Search methods: We searched the Cochrane Upper Gastrointestinal and Pancreatic Diseases Group Specialised Register and Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE and EMBASE, reference lists of relevant review articles and searched in the Science Citation Index for all the trials identified. All searches were updated in February 2009.Selection criteria: Randomised controlled trials comparing oral cisapride therapy with placebo or other non-surgical treatments for children diagnosed with GOR were included. We excluded trials with a majority of participants less than 28 days of age.Data collection and analysis: Primary outcomes were a change in symptoms at the end of treatment, presence of adverse events, occurrence of clinical complications and weight gain. Secondary outcomes included physiological measures of GOR or histological evidence of oesophagitis. We dichotomised symptoms into 'same or worse' versus 'improved' and calculated summary odds ratios (OR). Continuous measures of GOR (for example reflux index) were summarised as a weighted mean difference. All outcomes were analysed using a random-effects method.Main results: Ten trials in total met the inclusion criteria. Nine trials compared cisapride with placebo or no treatment, of which eight (262 participants) reported data on symptoms of gastro-oesophageal reflux. There was no statistically significant difference between the two interventions (OR 0.34; 95% CI 0.10 to 1.19) for 'same or worse' versus 'improved symptoms' at the end of treatment. There was significant heterogeneity between the studies, suggesting publication bias. Four studies reported adverse events (mainly diarrhoea); this difference was not statistically significant (OR 1.80; 95% CI 0.87 to 3.70). Another trial found no difference in the electrocardiographic QTc interval after three to eight weeks of treatment. Cisapride significantly reduced the reflux index (weighted mean difference -6.49; 95% CI -10.13 to -2.85; P = 0.0005). Other measures of oesophageal pH monitoring did not reach significance. One included study compared cisapride with Gaviscon (with no statistically significant difference). One small study found no evidence of benefit on frequency of regurgitation or weight gain after treatment with cisapride versus no treatment, carob bean or corn syrup thickeners.Authors' conclusions: We found no clear evidence that cisapride reduces symptoms of GOR. Due to reports of fatal cardiac arrhythmias or sudden death, from July 2000 in the USA and Europe cisapride was restricted to a limited access programme supervised by a paediatric gastrologist.US: http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD002300.pub2/abstractRecord #240 of 271ID: CD004222AU: Dodd Jodie MAU: Dare Marianna RAU: Middleton PhilippaTI: Treatment for women with postpartum iron deficiency anaemiaSO: Cochrane Database of Systematic ReviewsYR: 2004NO: 4PB: John Wiley & Sons, LtdKY: Anemia, Iron-Deficiency [blood] [drug therapy];Erythropoietin [therapeutic use];Iron [therapeutic use];Puerperal Disorders [blood] [drug therapy];Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic;Female[checkword];Humans[checkword]CC: PREGDOI: 10.1002/14651858.CD004222.pub2AB: Background: Postpartum anaemia is associated with breathlessness, tiredness, palpitations and maternal infections. Blood transfusions or iron supplementation have been used in the treatment of iron deficiency anaemia. Recently other anaemia treatments, in particular erythropoietin therapy, have also been used.Objectives: To assess the clinical effects of treatments for postpartum anaemia, including oral, intravenous or subcutaneous iron/folate supplementation and erythropoietin administration, and blood transfusion.Search methods: We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (30 May 2004), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (The Cochrane Library, Issue 1, 2003), MEDLINE (1966 to March 2003), EMBASE (1980 to March 2003), Current Contents and ACP Journal Club (from inception to March 2003). We updated this search on 7 June 2012 and added the results to the awaiting classification section.Selection criteria: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing therapy for postpartum iron deficiency anaemia (oral, intravenous or subcutaneous administration of iron, folate, erythropoietin or blood transfusion) with placebo, another treatment or no treatment.Data collection and analysis: Two reviewers independently assessed trial quality and extracted data.Main results: Six included RCTs involving 411 women described treatment with erythropoietin or iron as their primary interventions. No RCTs were identified that assessed treatment with blood transfusion. Few outcomes relating to clinical maternal and neonatal factors were reported: studies focused largely on surrogate outcomes such as haematological indices. Overall, the methodological quality of the included RCTs was reasonable; however, their usefulness in this review is restricted by the interventions and outcomes reported.When compared with iron therapy only, erythropoietin increased the likelihood of lactation at discharge from hospital (1 RCT, n = 40; relative risk (RR) 1.90, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.21 to 2.98). No apparent effect on need for blood transfusions was found, when erythropoietin plus iron was compared to treatment with iron only (2 RCTs, n = 100; RR 0.20, 95% CI 0.01 to 3.92), although the RCTs may have been of insufficient size to rule out important clinical differences. Haematological indices (haemoglobin and haemocrit) showed some increases when erythropoietin was compared to iron only, iron and folate, but not when compared with placebo.Authors' conclusions: There is some limited evidence of favourable outcomes for treatment of postpartum anaemia with erythropoietin. However, most of the available literature focuses on laboratory haematological indices, rather than clinical outcomes. Further high-quality trials assessing the treatment of postpartum anaemia with iron supplementation and blood transfusions are required. Future trials may also examine the significance of the severity of anaemia in relation to treatment, and an iron-rich diet as an intervention.[Note: The 27 citations in the awaiting classification section of the review may alter the conclusions of the review once assessed.]US: http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD004222.pub2/abstractRecord #241 of 271ID: CD004754AU: Escribano JoaquinAU: Balaguer AlbertAU: Pagone FilomenaAU: Feliu AlbertAU: Roqué i Figuls MartaTI: Pharmacological interventions for preventing complications in idiopathic hypercalciuriaSO: Cochrane Database of Systematic ReviewsYR: 2009NO: 1PB: John Wiley & Sons, LtdKY: Diuretics [therapeutic use];Drinking;Hypercalciuria [complications] [diet therapy] [drug therapy];Kidney Calculi [etiology] [prevention & control];Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic;Thiazides [therapeutic use];Water [administration & dosage];Adult[checkword];Humans[checkword]CC: RENALDOI: 10.1002/14651858.CD004754.pub2AB: Background: Idiopathic hypercalciuria is an inherited metabolic abnormality characterised by excessive amounts of calcium excreted into the urine in patients with normal serum levels of calcium. The morbidity of hypercalciuria is related to kidney stone disease and bone demineralization. In children, hypercalciuria can cause recurrent haematuria, frequency-dysuria syndrome, urinary tract infection and abdominal and lumbar pain. Several pharmacological treatments have been described that can decrease the levels of urinary calcium or its index of urinary crystallization.Objectives: To assess the benefits and harms of pharmacological interventions for preventing complications and decreasing urological symptoms in patients with idiopathic hypercalciuria.Search methods: We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, the Cochrane Renal Group's specialised register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, The Cochrane Library), handsearched relevant conference proceedings and reference lists of articles.Selection criteria: All randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTS that compared any pharmacological intervention for preventing complications in idiopathic hypercalciuria, with placebo, other pharmacological intervention or a different administration mode or dose of the same treatment given for a minimum duration of four months and had a follow-up period of at least six months.Data collection and analysis: Four authors assessed the studies for inclusion and extracted the data. Disagreements were resolved through discussion. Results were expressed as risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) or mean difference (MD).Main results: Five studies (316 adult patients) were included. Four compared thiazides with standard treatment (periodic clinical follow-up and increased water intake) or specific dietary recommendations and one analysed the effect of thiazide plus a neutral potassium salt. There was a significant decrease in the number of new stone recurrences in those treated with thiazides (RR 1.61, 95% CI 1.33 to 1.96), although the follow-up periods varied. The stone formation rate also showed a statistically significant decrease in the patients treated with diuretics (MD -0.18, 95% CI -0.30 to -0.06). Thiazides plus potassium salts significantly decreased calciuria and vitamin D levels.Authors' conclusions: There is some evidence that in patients with idiopathic hypercalciuria and recurrent stones, the addition of thiazides to a normal or modified diet for short to long periods (five months to three years) reduced the number of stone recurrences and decreased the stone formation rate. Thiazides and neutral potassium phosphate decreased calciuria in symptomatic patients with idiopathic hypercalciuria. There were no studies investigating the effect of pharmacological treatment on other clinical complications or asymptomatic idiopathic hypercalciuria.US: http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD004754.pub2/abstractRecord #242 of 271ID: CD009578AU: Middleton PhilippaAU: Crowther Caroline ATI: Reminder systems for women with previous gestational diabetes mellitus to increase uptake of testing for type 2 diabetes or impaired glucose toleranceSO: Cochrane Database of Systematic ReviewsYR: 2014NO: 3PB: John Wiley & Sons, LtdKY: Diabetes, Gestational;Reminder Systems;Correspondence as Topic;Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2 [diagnosis];Glucose Intolerance [diagnosis];Glucose Tolerance Test [utilization];Postpartum Period;Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic;Female[checkword];Humans[checkword];Pregnancy[checkword]CC: ENDOCDOI: 10.1002/14651858.CD009578.pub2AB: Background: The early postpartum period is an important time in which to identify the risk of diabetes in women with a history of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). Oral glucose tolerance and other tests can help guide lifestyle management and monitoring to reduce the future risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus.Objectives: To assess whether reminder systems increase the uptake of testing for type 2 diabetes or impaired glucose tolerance in women with a history of GDM.Search methods: We searched MEDLINE and EMBASE (last searched 1 June 2013) and The Cochrane Library (last searched April 2013).Selection criteria: We included randomised trials of women who had experienced GDM in the index pregnancy and who were then sent any modality of reminder (or control) to complete a test for type 2 diabetes after giving birth.Data collection and analysis: Two authors independently screened titles and abstracts for relevance. One author extracted the data, carried out 'Risk of bias' assessments and evaluated the overall study quality according to GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation) criteria; the other author double-checked these procedures. Meta-analysis was not possible as only one study was eligible for inclusion.Main results: Only one trial with an unclear risk of bias in the majority of domains was included in the study; the overall study quality was judged to be low. This factorial trial of 256 women compared three types of postal reminder strategies (in a total of 213 women) with usual care (no postal reminder, 43 women) and reported on the uptake of four possible types of glucose tests. The three strategies investigated were: reminders sent to both the woman and the physician; reminder sent to the woman only; and reminder sent to the physician only, all issued approximately three months after the woman had given birth.There was low-quality evidence that all three reminder interventions increased uptake of oral glucose tolerance tests compared with usual care (no reminder system): reminders to the woman and the physician (uptake 60% versus 14%): risk ratio 4.23 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.85 to 9.71); 116 participants); reminder to the woman only (uptake 55% versus 14%): RR 3.87 (95% CI 1.68 to 8.93); 111 participants); reminder to the physician only (uptake 52% versus 14%): RR 3.61 (95% CI 1.50 to 8.71); 66 participants). This represented an increase in uptake from 14% in the no reminder group to 57% across the three reminder groups. There was also an increase in uptake of fasting glucose tests in the reminder group compared with the usual care group: reminders to the woman and the physician versus no reminder (uptake 63% versus 40%): RR 1.57 (95% CI 1.01 to 2.44); reminder to the woman only (uptake 71% versus 40%): RR 1.78 (95% CI 1.16 to 2.73); reminder to the physician only (uptake 68% versus 40%): RR 1.69 (95% CI 1.06 to 2.72). Uptake of random glucose and glycated haemoglobin A1c tests was low, and no statistically significant differences were seen between the reminder and no reminder groups for these tests. Uptake of any test was higher in each of the reminder groups compared with the no reminder group (RR 1.65 (95% CI 1.12 to 2.41); 1.73 (95% CI 1.18 to 2.52); and 1.55 (95% CI 1.01 to 2.38) in the respective reminder groups.The trial did not report this review's other primary outcomes (proportion of women diagnosed with type 2 diabetes or showing impaired glucose tolerance or impaired fasting glucose after giving birth; or health-related quality of life). Nor did it report any secondary review outcomes such as diabetes-associated morbidity, lifestyle changes, need for insulin, recurrence of GDM or women's and/or health professionals' views of the intervention. No adverse events of the intervention were reported.Subgroup interaction tests gave no indication that dual reminders (to both women and physicians) were more successful than single reminders to either women or physicians alone. It was also not clear if test uptakes between women in the reminder and no reminder groups differed by type of glucose test undertaken.Authors' conclusions: Results from the only trial that fulfilled our inclusion criteria showed low-quality evidence for a marked increase in the uptake of testing for type 2 diabetes in women with previous GDM following the issue of postal reminders. The effects of other forms of reminder systems need to be assessed to see whether test uptake also increases when email and telephone reminders are deployed. We also need a better understanding of why some women fail to take opportunities to be screened postpartum. As the ultimate aim of increasing postpartum testing is to prevent the subsequent development of type 2 diabetes, it is important to determine whether increased test uptake rates also increase women's use of preventive strategies such as lifestyle modifications.US: http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD009578.pub2/abstractRecord #243 of 271ID: CD012114AU: Brennan LeahAU: Murphy Kylie DAU: de la Piedad Garcia XochitlAU: Ellis Miriam EAU: Metzendorf Maria-IntiAU: McKenzie Joanne ETI: Psychological interventions for adults who are overweight or obeseSO: Cochrane Database of Systematic ReviewsYR: 2016NO: 3PB: John Wiley & Sons, LtdCC: ENDOCDOI: 10.1002/14651858.CD012114AB: This is the protocol for a review and there is no abstract.

It is important to determine if dietary polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) given as supplements or added to infant formula prevent the development of allergy.Objectives: To determine the effect of higher PUFA intake during infancy to prevent allergic disease.Search methods: We used the standard search strategy of the Cochrane Neonatal Review group to search the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL 2015, Issue 9), MEDLINE (1966 to 14 September 2015), EMBASE (1980 to 14 September 2015) and CINAHL (1982 to 14 September 2015). We also searched clinical trials databases, conference proceedings, and the reference lists of retrieved articles for randomised controlled trials and quasi-randomised trials.Selection criteria: Randomised and quasi-randomised controlled trials that compared the use of a PUFA with no PUFA in infants for the prevention of allergy.Data collection and analysis: Two review authors independently selected trials, assessed trial quality and extracted data from the included studies. We used fixed-effect analyses. The treatment effects were expressed as risk ratio (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). We used the GRADE approach to assess the quality of evidence.Main results: The search found 17 studies that assessed the effect of higher versus lower intake of PUFAs on allergic outcomes in infants. Only nine studies enrolling 2704 infants reported allergy outcomes that could be used in meta-analyses. Of these, there were methodological concerns for eight.In infants up to two years of age, meta-analyses found no difference in incidence of all allergy (1 study, 323 infants; RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.73 to 1.26; risk difference (RD) -0.02, 95% CI -0.12 to 0.09; heterogeneity not applicable), asthma (3 studies, 1162 infants; RR 1.04, 95% CI 0.80 to 1.35, I2 = 0%; RD 0.01, 95% CI -0.04 to 0.05, I2 = 0%), dermatitis/eczema (7 studies, 1906 infants; RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.06, I2 = 0%; RD -0.02, 95% CI -0.06 to 0.02, I2 = 0%) or food allergy (3 studies, 915 infants; RR 0.81, 95% CI 0.56 to 1.19, I2 = 63%; RD -0.02, 95% CI -0.06 to 0.02, I2 = 74%). There was a reduction in allergic rhinitis (2 studies, 594 infants; RR 0.47, 95% CI 0.23 to 0.96, I2 = 6%; RD -0.04, 95% CI -0.08 to -0.00, I2 = 54%; number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) 25, 95% CI 13 to ∞).In children aged two to five years, meta-analysis found no difference in incidence of all allergic disease (2 studies, 154 infants; RR 0.69, 95% CI 0.47 to 1.02, I2 = 43%; RD -0.16, 95% CI -0.31 to -0.00, I2 = 63%; NNTB 6, 95% CI 3 to ∞), asthma (1 study, 89 infants; RR 0.45, 95% CI 0.20 to 1.02; RD -0.20, 95% CI -0.37 to -0.02; heterogeneity not applicable; NNTB 5, 95% CI 3 to 50), dermatitis/eczema (2 studies, 154 infants; RR 0.65, 95% CI 0.34 to 1.24, I2 = 0%; RD -0.09 95% CI -0.22 to 0.04, I2 = 24%) or food allergy (1 study, 65 infants; RR 2.27, 95% CI 0.25 to 20.68; RD 0.05, 95% CI -0.07 to 0.16; heterogeneity not applicable).In children aged two to five years, meta-analysis found no difference in prevalence of all allergic disease (2 studies, 633 infants; RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.81 to 1.19, I2 = 36%; RD -0.01, 95% CI -0.08 to 0.07, I2 = 0%), asthma (2 studies, 635 infants; RR 1.12, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.53, I2 = 0%; RD 0.02, 95% CI -0.04 to 0.09, I2 = 0%), dermatitis/eczema (2 studies, 635 infants; RR 0.81, 95% CI 0.59 to 1.09, I2 = 0%; RD -0.04 95% CI -0.11 to 0.02, I2 = 0%), allergic rhinitis (2 studies, 635 infants; RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.83 to 1.25, I2 = 0%; RD 0.01, 95% CI -0.06 to 0.08, I2 = 0%) or food allergy (1 study, 119 infants; RR 0.27, 95% CI 0.06 to 1.19; RD -0.10, 95% CI -0.20 to -0.00; heterogeneity not applicable; NNTB 10, 95% CI 5 to ∞).Authors' conclusions: There is no evidence that PUFA supplementation in infancy has an effect on infant or childhood allergy, asthma, dermatitis/eczema or food allergy. However, the quality of evidence was very low. There was insufficient evidence to determine an effect on allergic rhinitis.US: http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD010112.pub2/abstractRecord #245 of 271ID: CD011448AU: Rungsiprakarn PhassawanAU: Laopaiboon MalineeAU: Sangkomkamhang Ussanee SAU: Lumbiganon PisakeAU: Pratt Jeremy JTI: Interventions for treating constipation in pregnancySO: Cochrane Database of Systematic ReviewsYR: 2015NO: 9PB: John Wiley & Sons, LtdKY: Constipation [therapy];Dietary Fiber [therapeutic use];Laxatives [therapeutic use];Pregnancy Complications [therapy];Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic;Adult[checkword];Female[checkword];Humans[checkword];Pregnancy[checkword]CC: PREGDOI: 10.1002/14651858.CD011448.pub2AB: Background: Constipation is a common symptom experienced during pregnancy. It has a range of consequences from reduced quality of life and perception of physical health to haemorrhoids. An understanding of the effectiveness and safety of treatments for constipation in pregnancy is important for the clinician managing pregnant women.Objectives: To assess the effectiveness and safety of interventions (pharmacological and non-pharmacological) for treating constipation in pregnancy.Search methods: We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (30 April 2015), ClinicalTrials.gov and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) (30 April 2015) and reference lists of retrieved studies.Selection criteria: We considered all published, unpublished and ongoing randomised controlled trials (RCTs), cluster-RCTs and quasi-RCTs, evaluating interventions (pharmacological and non-pharmacological) for constipation in pregnancy. Cross-over studies were not eligible for inclusion in this review. Trials published in abstract form only (without full text publication) were not eligible for inclusion.We compared one intervention (pharmacological or non-pharmacological) against another intervention, placebo or no treatment.Data collection and analysis: Two review authors independently assessed trials for inclusion and risk of bias, extracted data and checked them for accuracy.Main results: Four studies were included, but only two studies with a total of 180 women contributed data to this review. It was not clear whether they were RCTs or quasi-RCTs because the sequence generation was unclear. We classified the overall risk of bias of three studies as moderate and one study as high risk of bias. No meta-analyses were carried out due to insufficient data.There were no cluster-RCTs identified for inclusion. Comparisons were available for stimulant laxatives versus bulk-forming laxatives, and fibre supplementation versus no intervention. There were no data available for any other comparisons.During the review process we found that studies reported changes in symptoms in different ways. To capture all data available, we added a new primary outcome (improvement in constipation) - this new outcome was not prespecified in our published protocol. Stimulant laxatives versus bulk-forming laxativesNo data were identified for any of this review's prespecified primary outcomes: pain on defecation, frequency of stools and consistency of stools.Compared to bulk-forming laxatives, pregnant women who received stimulant laxatives (Senokot or Normax) had an improvement in constipation (risk ratio (RR) 1.59, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.21 to 2.09; 140 women, one study, moderate quality of evidence), but also had more abdominal discomfort (RR 2.33, 95% CI 1.15 to 4.73; 140 women, one study, low quality of evidence), and a borderline difference in diarrhoea (RR 4.50, 95% CI 1.01 to 20.09; 140 women, one study, moderate quality of evidence). In addition, there was no clear difference in women's satisfaction (RR 1.06, 95% CI 0.77 to 1.46; 140 women, one study, moderate quality of evidence).One of the stimulant laxatives, Normax (dioctyl sodium sulphosuccinate and dihydroxy anthraquinone) is no longer used for the treatment of constipation in pregnant women (and the package information advises that it should not be used during pregnancy or breastfeeding). We therefore carried out a non-prespecified sensitivity analysis with the data for Senokot and Normax presented separately. Results for Senokot and Normax were very similar, thus results for the individual drugs largely reflected findings for the combined analysis, although when individual drugs were compared with bulk-forming laxatives there was no longer a clear difference between groups in terms of abdominal discomfort and diarrhoea.No usable data were identified for any of this review's secondary outcomes: quality of life; dehydration; electrolyte imbalance; acute allergic reaction; or asthma. Fibre supplementation versus no interventionPregnant women who received fibre supplementation had a higher frequency of stools compared to no intervention (mean difference (MD) 2.24 times per week, 95% CI 0.96 to 3.52; 40 women, one study, moderate quality of evidence). Fibre supplementation was associated with improved stool consistency as defined by trialists (hard stool decreased by 11% to 14%, normal stool increased by 5% to 10%, and loose stool increased by 0% to 6%).No usable data were reported for either the primary outcomes of pain on defecation and improvement in constipation or any of this review's secondary outcomes as listed above. QualityFive outcomes were assessed with the GRADE software: improvement in constipation, frequency of stools, abdominal discomfort, diarrhoea and women's satisfaction. These were assessed to be of moderate quality except for abdominal discomfort which was assessed to be of low quality. The results should therefore be interpreted with caution. There were no data available for evaluation of pain on defecation or consistency of stools.Authors' conclusions: There is insufficient evidence to comprehensively assess the effectiveness and safety of interventions (pharmacological and non-pharmacological) for treating constipation in pregnancy, due to limited data (few studies with small sample size and no meta-analyses). Compared with bulk-forming laxatives, stimulant laxatives appear to be more effective in improvement of constipation (moderate quality evidence), but are accompanied by an increase in diarrhoea (moderate quality evidence) and abdominal discomfort (low quality evidence) and no difference in women's satisfaction (moderate quality evidence). Additionally, fibre supplementation may increase frequency of stools compared with no intervention (moderate quality evidence), although these results were of moderate risk of bias.There were no data for a comparison of other types of interventions, such as osmotic laxatives, stool softeners, lubricant laxatives and enemas and suppositories.More RCTs evaluating interventions for treating constipation in pregnancy are needed. These should cover different settings and evaluate the effectiveness of various interventions (including fibre, osmotic, and stimulant laxatives) on improvement in constipation, pain on defecation, frequency of stools and consistency of stools.US: http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD011448.pub2/abstractRecord #246 of 271ID: CD004778AU: Sanabria AlvaroAU: Villegas Maria IsabelAU: Morales Uribe Carlos HernandoTI: Laparoscopic repair for perforated peptic ulcer diseaseSO: Cochrane Database of Systematic ReviewsYR: 2013NO: 2PB: John Wiley & Sons, LtdKY: Laparoscopy;Peptic Ulcer Perforation [surgery];Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic;Humans[checkword]CC: UPPERGIDOI: 10.1002/14651858.CD004778.pub3AB: Background: Perforated peptic ulcer is a common abdominal disease that is treated by surgery. The development of laparoscopic surgery has changed the way to treat such abdominal surgical emergencies. The results of some clinical trials suggest that laparoscopic surgery could be a better strategy than open surgery in the correction of perforated peptic ulcer but the evidence is not strongly in favour for or against this intervention.Objectives: To measure the effect of laparoscopic surgical treatment versus open surgical treatment in patients with a diagnosis of perforated peptic ulcer in relation to abdominal septic complications, surgical wound infection, extra-abdominal complications, hospital length of stay and direct costs.Search methods: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) on The Cochrane Library (2004, Issue 2), PubMed/MEDLINE (1966 to July 2004), EMBASE (1985 to November 2004) and LILACS (1988 to November 2004) as well as the reference lists of relevant articles. Searches in all databases were updated in December 2009 and January 2012. We did not confine our search to English language publications.Selection criteria: Randomized clinical trials comparing laparoscopic surgery versus open surgery for the repair of perforated peptic ulcer using any mechanical method of closure (suture, omental patch or fibrin sealant).Data collection and analysis: Primary outcome measures included proportion of septic and other abdominal complications (surgical site infection, suture leakage, intra-abdominal abscess, postoperative ileus) and extra-abdominal complications (pulmonary). Secondary outcomes included mortality, time to return to normal diet, time of nasogastric aspiration, hospital length-of-stay and costs. Outcomes were summarized by reporting odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs), using the fixed-effect model.Main results: We included three randomized clinical trials of acceptable quality. We found no statistically significant differences between laparoscopic and open surgery in the proportion of abdominal septic complications (OR 0.66; 95% CI 0.30 to 1.47), pulmonary complications (OR 0.52; 95% CI 0.08 to 3.55) or number of septic abdominal complications (OR 0.60; 95% CI 0.32 to 1.15). Heterogeneity was significant for pulmonary complications and operating time.Authors' conclusions: This review suggests that a decrease in septic abdominal complications may exist when laparoscopic surgery is used to correct perforated peptic ulcer. However, it is necessary to perform more randomized controlled trials with a greater number of patients to confirm such an assumption, guaranteeing a long learning curve for participating surgeons. With the information provided it could be said that laparoscopic surgery results are not clinically different from those of open surgery.US: http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD004778.pub3/abstractRecord #247 of 271ID: CD010334AU: van Zuuren Esther JAU: Fedorowicz ZbysAU: Carter BenAU: Pandis NikolaosTI: Interventions for hirsutism (excluding laser and photoepilation therapy alone)SO: Cochrane Database of Systematic ReviewsYR: 2015NO: 4PB: John Wiley & Sons, LtdKY: 5-alpha Reductase Inhibitors [therapeutic use];Androgen Antagonists [therapeutic use];Body Mass Index;Contraceptive Agents, Female [therapeutic use];Cyproterone Acetate [therapeutic use];Desogestrel [therapeutic use];Drug Combinations;Eflornithine [therapeutic use];Ethinyl Estradiol [therapeutic use];Finasteride [therapeutic use];Flutamide [therapeutic use];Hirsutism [drug therapy];Hypoglycemic Agents [therapeutic use];Metformin [therapeutic use];Quality of Life;Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic;Spironolactone [therapeutic use];Adult[checkword];Female[checkword];Humans[checkword]DOI: 10.1002/14651858.CD010334.pub2AB: Background: Hirsutism occurs in 5% to 10% of women of reproductive age when there is excessive terminal hair growth in androgen-sensitive areas (male pattern). It is a distressing disorder with a major impact on quality of life. The most common cause is polycystic ovary syndrome. There are many treatment options, but it is not clear which are most effective.Objectives: To assess the effects of interventions (except laser and light-based therapies alone) for hirsutism.Search methods: We searched the Cochrane Skin Group Specialised Register, CENTRAL (2014, Issue 6), MEDLINE (from 1946), EMBASE (from 1974), and five trials registers, and checked reference lists of included studies for additional trials. The last search was in June 2014.Selection criteria: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in hirsute women with polycystic ovary syndrome, idiopathic hirsutism, or idiopathic hyperandrogenism.Data collection and analysis: Two independent authors carried out study selection, data extraction, 'Risk of bias' assessment, and analyses.Main results: We included 157 studies (sample size 30 to 80) comprising 10,550 women (mean age 25 years). The majority of studies (123/157) were 'high', 30 'unclear', and four 'low' risk of bias. Lack of blinding was the most frequent source of bias. Treatment duration was six to 12 months. Forty-eight studies provided no usable or retrievable data, i.e. lack of separate data for hirsute women, conference proceedings, and losses to follow-up above 40%.Primary outcomes, 'participant-reported improvement of hirsutism' and 'change in health-related quality of life', were addressed in few studies, and adverse events in only half. In most comparisons there was insufficient evidence to determine if the number of reported adverse events differed. These included known adverse events: gastrointestinal discomfort, breast tenderness, reduced libido, dry skin (flutamide and finasteride); irregular bleeding (spironolactone); nausea, diarrhoea, bloating (metformin); hot flushes, decreased libido, vaginal dryness, headaches (gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) analogues)).Clinician's evaluation of hirsutism and change in androgen levels were addressed in most comparisons, change in body mass index (BMI) and improvement of other clinical signs of hyperandrogenism in one-third of studies.The quality of evidence was moderate to very low for most outcomes.There was low quality evidence for the effect of two oral contraceptive pills (OCPs) (ethinyl estradiol + cyproterone acetate versus ethinyl estradiol + desogestrel) on change from baseline of Ferriman-Gallwey scores. The mean difference (MD) was -1.84 (95% confidence interval (CI) -3.86 to 0.18).There was very low quality evidence that flutamide 250 mg, twice daily, reduced Ferriman-Gallwey scores more effectively than placebo (MD -7.60, 95% CI -10.53 to -4.67 and MD -7.20, 95% CI -10.15 to -4.25). Participants' evaluations in one study with 20 participants confirmed these results (risk ratio (RR) 17.00, 95% CI 1.11 to 259.87).Spironolactone 100 mg daily was more effective than placebo in reducing Ferriman-Gallwey scores (MD -7.69, 95% CI -10.12 to -5.26) (low quality evidence). It showed similar effectiveness to flutamide in two studies (MD -1.90, 95% CI -5.01 to 1.21 and MD 0.49, 95% CI -1.99 to 2.97) (very low quality evidence), as well as to finasteride in two studies (MD 1.49, 95% CI -0.58 to 3.56 and MD 0.40, 95% CI -1.18 to 1.98) (low quality evidence).Although there was very low quality evidence of a difference in reduction of Ferriman-Gallwey scores for finasteride 5 mg to 7.5 mg daily versus placebo (MD -5.73, 95% CI -6.87 to -4.58), it was unlikely it was clinically meaningful. These results were reinforced by participants' assessments (RR 2.06, 95% CI 0.99 to 4.29 and RR 11.00, 95% CI 0.69 to 175.86). However, finasteride showed inconsistent results in comparisons with other treatments, and no firm conclusions could be reached.Metformin demonstrated no benefit over placebo in reduction of Ferriman-Gallwey scores (MD 0.05, 95% CI -1.02 to 1.12), but the quality of evidence was low. Results regarding the effectiveness of GnRH analogues were inconsistent, varying from minimal to important improvements.We were unable to pool data for OCPs with cyproterone acetate 20 mg to 100 mg due to clinical and methodological heterogeneity between studies. However, addition of cyproterone acetate to OCPs provided greater reductions in Ferriman-Gallwey scores.Two studies, comparing finasteride 5 mg and spironolactone 100 mg, did not show differences in participant assessments and reduction of Ferriman-Gallwey scores (low quality evidence). Ferriman-Gallwey scores from three studies comparing flutamide versus metformin could not be pooled (I² = 62%). One study comparing flutamide 250 mg twice daily with metformin 850 mg twice daily for 12 months, which reached a higher cumulative dosage than two other studies evaluating this comparison, showed flutamide to be more effective (MD -6.30, 95% CI -9.83 to -2.77) (very low quality evidence). Data showing reductions in Ferriman-Gallwey scores could not be pooled for four studies comparing finasteride with flutamide as the results were inconsistent (I² = 67%).Studies examining effects of hypocaloric diets reported reductions in BMI, but which did not result in reductions in Ferriman-Gallwey scores. Although certain cosmetic measures are commonly used, we did not identify any relevant RCTs.Authors' conclusions: Treatments may need to incorporate pharmacological therapies, cosmetic procedures, and psychological support. For mild hirsutism there is evidence of limited quality that OCPs are effective. Flutamide 250 mg twice daily and spironolactone 100 mg daily appeared to be effective and safe, albeit the evidence was low to very low quality. Finasteride 5 mg daily showed inconsistent results in different comparisons, therefore no firm conclusions can be made. As the side effects of antiandrogens and finasteride are well known, these should be accounted for in any clinical decision-making. There was low quality evidence that metformin was ineffective for hirsutism and although GnRH analogues showed inconsistent results in reducing hirsutism they do have significant side effects.Further research should consist of well-designed, rigorously reported, head-to-head trials examining OCPs combined with antiandrogens or 5α-reductase inhibitor against OCP monotherapy, as well as the different antiandrogens and 5α-reductase inhibitors against each other. Outcomes should be based on standardised scales of participants' assessment of treatment efficacy, with a greater emphasis on change in quality of life as a result of treatment.US: http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD010334.pub2/abstractRecord #248 of 271ID: CD008288AU: Sridharan KalpanaAU: Mohan RoshniAU: Ramaratnam SridharanAU: Panneerselvam DeepakTI: Ayurvedic treatments for diabetes mellitusSO: Cochrane Database of Systematic ReviewsYR: 2011NO: 12PB: John Wiley & Sons, LtdKY: Medicine, Ayurvedic;Diabetes Mellitus [drug therapy];Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2 [drug therapy];Phytotherapy [methods];Plant Extracts [therapeutic use];Plant Preparations [therapeutic use];Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic;Adult[checkword];Humans[checkword]CC: ENDOCDOI: 10.1002/14651858.CD008288.pub2AB: Background: Patients with diabetes frequently use complimentary and alternative medications including Ayurvedic medications and hence it is important to determine their efficacy and safety.Objectives: To assess the effects of Ayurvedic treatments for diabetes mellitus.Search methods: We searched The Cochrane Library (issue 10, 2011), MEDLINE (until 31 August 2011), EMBASE (until 31 August 2011), AMED (until 14 October 2011), the database of randomised trials from South Asia (until 14 October 2011), the database of the grey literature (OpenSigle, until 14 October 2011) and databases of ongoing trials (until 14 October 2011). In addition we performed hand searches of several journals and reference lists of potentially relevant trials.Selection criteria: We included randomized trials of at least two months duration of Ayurvedic interventions for diabetes mellitus. Participants of both genders, all ages and any type of diabetes were included irrespective of duration of diabetes, antidiabetic treatment, comorbidity or diabetes related complications.Data collection and analysis: Two authors independently extracted data. Risk of bias of trials was evaluated as indicated in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Intervention.Main results: Results of only a limited number of studies could be combined, in view of different types of interventions and variable quality of data. We found six trials of proprietary herbal mixtures and one of whole system Ayurvedic treatment. These studies enrolled 354 participants ( 172 on treatment, 158 on controls, 24 allocation unknown). The treatment duration ranged from 3 to 6 months. All these studies included adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus.With regard to our primary outcomes, significant reductions in glycosylated haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), fasting blood sugar (FBS) or both were observed with Diabecon, Inolter and Cogent DB compared to placebo or no additional treatment, while no significant hypoglycaemic response was found with Pancreas tonic and Hyponidd treatment. The study of whole system Ayurvedic treatment did not provide data on HbA1c and FBS values. One study of Pancreas tonic treatment did not detect a significant change in health-related quality of life. The main adverse effects reported were drug hypersensitivity (one study, one patient in the treatment arm); hypoglycaemic episodes (one study, one participant in the treatment arm; none had severe hypoglycaemia) and gastrointestinal side effects in one study (1 of 20 in the intervention group and 0 of 20 participants in the control group). None of the included studies reported any deaths, renal, hematological or liver toxicity.With regard to our secondary outcomes, post prandial blood sugar (PPBS) was lower among participants treated with Diabecon, was unchanged with Hyponidd and was higher in patients treated with Cogent DB. Treatment with Pancreas tonic and Hyponidd did not affect lipid profile significantly, while patients treated with Inolter had significantly higher HDL- and lower LDL-cholesterol as well as lower triglycerides. Cogent DB treated participants also had lower total cholesterol and triglycerides.Studies of treatment with Diabecon reported increased fasting insulin levels; one study of treatment with Diabecon reported higher stimulated insulin levels and fasting C-peptide levels in the treatment group. There was no significant difference in fasting and stimulated C-peptide and insulin levels with Hyponidd, Cogent DB and Pancreas tonic treatment. The study of Inolter did not assess these outcomes.No study reported on or was designed to investigate diabetic complications, death from any cause and economic data.Authors' conclusions: Although there were significant glucose-lowering effects with the use of some herbal mixtures, due to methodological deficiencies and small sample sizes we are unable to draw any definite conclusions regarding their efficacy. Though no significant adverse events were reported, there is insufficient evidence at present to recommend the use of these interventions in routine clinical practice and further studies are needed.US: http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD008288.pub2/abstractRecord #249 of 271ID: CD011677AU: Williams Christopher MAU: Nathan Nicole KAU: Wyse Rebecca JAU: Yoong Sze LinAU: Delaney TessaAU: Wiggers JohnAU: Sutherland RachelAU: Freund MeganAU: Hodder Rebecca KAU: Wolfenden LukeTI: Strategies for enhancing the implementation of school-based policies or practices targeting risk factors for chronic diseaseSO: Cochrane Database of Systematic ReviewsYR: 2015NO: 5PB: John Wiley & Sons, LtdCC: PUBHLTHDOI: 10.1002/14651858.CD011677AB: This is the protocol for a review and there is no abstract.

Poor dietary intake of vitamins has been associated with an increased risk of miscarriage, therefore supplementing women with vitamins either prior to or in early pregnancy may help prevent miscarriage.Objectives: The objectives of this review were to determine the effectiveness and safety of any vitamin supplementation, on the risk of spontaneous miscarriage.Search methods: We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group Trials Register (6 November 2015) and reference lists of retrieved studies.Selection criteria: All randomised and quasi-randomised trials comparing supplementation during pregnancy with one or more vitamins with either placebo, other vitamins, no vitamins or other interventions. We have included supplementation that started prior to conception, periconceptionally or in early pregnancy (less than 20 weeks' gestation).Data collection and analysis: Three review authors independently assessed trials for inclusion, extracted data and assessed trial quality. We assessed the quality of the evidence using the GRADE approach. The quality of evidence is included for numerical results of outcomes included in the 'Summary of findings' tables.Main results: We included a total of 40 trials (involving 276,820 women and 278,413 pregnancies) assessing supplementation with any vitamin(s) starting prior to 20 weeks' gestation and reporting at least one primary outcome that was eligible for the review. Eight trials were cluster-randomised and contributed data for 217,726 women and 219,267 pregnancies in total.Approximately half of the included trials were assessed to have a low risk of bias for both random sequence generation and adequate concealment of participants to treatment and control groups. Vitamin C supplementationThere was no difference in the risk of total fetal loss (risk ratio (RR) 1.14, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.92 to 1.40, seven trials, 18,949 women; high-quality evidence); early or late miscarriage (RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.65 to 1.26, four trials, 13,346 women; moderate-quality evidence); stillbirth (RR 1.31, 95% CI 0.97 to 1.76, seven trials, 21,442 women; moderate-quality evidence) or adverse effects of vitamin supplementation (RR 1.16, 95% CI 0.39 to 3.41, one trial, 739 women; moderate-quality evidence) between women receiving vitamin C with vitamin E compared with placebo or no vitamin C groups. No clear differences were seen in the risk of total fetal loss or miscarriage between women receiving any other combination of vitamin C compared with placebo or no vitamin C groups. Vitamin A supplementationNo difference was found in the risk of total fetal loss (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.61 to 1.66, three trials, 1640 women; low-quality evidence); early or late miscarriage (RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.46 to 1.62, two trials, 1397 women; low-quality evidence) or stillbirth (RR 1.29, 95% CI 0.57 to 2.91, three trials, 1640 women; low-quality evidence) between women receiving vitamin A plus iron and folate compared with placebo or no vitamin A groups. There was no evidence of differences in the risk of total fetal loss or miscarriage between women receiving any other combination of vitamin A compared with placebo or no vitamin A groups. Multivitamin supplementationThere was evidence of a decrease in the risk for stillbirth among women receiving multivitamins plus iron and folic acid compared iron and folate only groups (RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.85 to 0.99, 10 trials, 79,851 women; high-quality evidence). Although total fetal loss was lower in women who were given multivitamins without folic acid (RR 0.49, 95% CI 0.34 to 0.70, one trial, 907 women); and multivitamins with or without vitamin A (RR 0.60, 95% CI 0.39 to 0.92, one trial, 1074 women), these findings included one trial each with small numbers of women involved. Also, they include studies where the comparison groups included women receiving either vitamin A or placebo, and thus require caution in interpretation.We found no difference in the risk of total fetal loss (RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.00, 10 trials, 94,948 women; high-quality evidence) or early or late miscarriage (RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.03, 10 trials, 94,948 women; moderate-quality evidence) between women receiving multivitamins plus iron and folic acid compared with iron and folate only groups.There was no evidence of differences in the risk of total fetal loss or miscarriage between women receiving any other combination of multivitamins compared with placebo, folic acid or vitamin A groups. Folic acid supplementationThere was no evidence of any difference in the risk of total fetal loss, early or late miscarriage, stillbirth or congenital malformations between women supplemented with folic acid with or without multivitamins and/or iron compared with no folic acid groups. Antioxidant vitamins supplementationThere was no evidence of differences in early or late miscarriage between women given antioxidant compared with the low antioxidant group (RR 1.12, 95% CI 0.24 to 5.29, one trial, 110 women).Authors' conclusions: Taking any vitamin supplements prior to pregnancy or in early pregnancy does not prevent women experiencing miscarriage. However, evidence showed that women receiving multivitamins plus iron and folic acid had reduced risk for stillbirth. There is insufficient evidence to examine the effects of different combinations of vitamins on miscarriage and miscarriage-related outcomes.US: http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD004073.pub4/abstractRecord #251 of 271ID: CD008007AU: Ilic DraganAU: Forbes Kristian MAU: Hassed CraigTI: Lycopene for the prevention of prostate cancerSO: Cochrane Database of Systematic ReviewsYR: 2011NO: 11PB: John Wiley & Sons, LtdKY: Anticarcinogenic Agents [therapeutic use];Carotenoids [therapeutic use];Prostate-Specific Antigen [blood];Prostatic Neoplasms [blood] [prevention & control];Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic;Humans[checkword];Male[checkword]DOI: 10.1002/14651858.CD008007.pub2AB: Background: Prostate cancer is a common cause of death in developed countries, yet the benefits of screening for prostate cancer still remain controversial. A prostate-specific antigen (PSA) test result greater than 4 ng/mL (nanograms/millilitre) has commonly been used as the cut-off level for seeking further tests to diagnose the presence (or absence) of prostate cancer. An increase in PSA levels may not necessarily be associated with an increased risk of prostate cancer, as PSA levels may also be increased in men with benign prostatic hyperplasia and prostatitis. Despite the uncertainty of the net benefit of early detection and treatment, safe and effective methods to prevent prostate cancer are of value. Consumers, seeking greater involvement in their healthcare, are increasingly turning to lifestyle modification and complementary and alternative medicines (CAMs) to maintain their health and prevent disease. Lycopene is a member of the carotenoid family, which is found abundantly in tomatoes, tomato-based products, strawberries, and watermelon. It has been hypothesised that lycopene is a strong antioxidant, which may lower the risk of cancer (including prostate cancer) in people who have diets rich in lycopene.Objectives: To determine whether lycopene reduces the incidence of prostate cancer and prostate cancer-specific mortality. Secondary objectives include changes in PSA levels, prostate symptoms and the nature of adverse events associated with lycopene use.Search methods: Electronic searches were conducted across MEDLINE, EMBASE and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) databases. No language or other limitations were imposed.Selection criteria: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that investigated the use of lycopene for the prevention of prostate cancer were eligible for inclusion in this review.Data collection and analysis: A search of electronic databases, performed in August 2011, identified 64 citations. All articles were selected for full-text review. From these citations, three studies were identified as meeting the inclusion criteria. Handsearching did not provide any additional studies.Main results: Three RCTs, with a total of 154 participants were included in this review. None of the studies reported data on prostate cancer mortality. All of the included studies differed with respect to design, participants included and allocation of lycopene. This clinical heterogeneity limits the value on the pooled estimated of the meta-analyses. The methodological quality of two of the three included studies was assessed as posing a 'high' risk of bias. Meta-analysis indicated no statistical difference in PSA levels between men randomised to receive lycopene and the comparison group (MD (mean difference) -0.34, 95% CI (confidence interval) -2.01 to 1.32). Only one study reported incidence of prostate cancer (10% in the lycopene group versus 30% in control group). The level of lycopene was also not statistically different in men randomised to receive lycopene and the comparison group (MD 0.39 µg/mL (micrograms/millilitre), 95% CI -0.19 to 0.98). No other meta-analyses were possible since other outcomes assessed only had one study contributing data.Authors' conclusions: Given that only three RCTs were included in this systematic review, and the high risk of bias in two of the three studies, there is insufficient evidence to either support, or refute, the use of lycopene for the prevention of prostate cancer. Similarly, there is no robust evidence from RCTs to identify the impact of lycopene consumption upon the incidence of prostate cancer, prostate symptoms, PSA levels or adverse events.US: http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD008007.pub2/abstractRecord #252 of 271ID: CD004274AU: Murray ElizabethAU: Burns JoanneAU: See Tai SharonAU: Lai RosalindAU: Nazareth IrwinTI: Interactive Health Communication Applications for people with chronic diseaseSO: Cochrane Database of Systematic ReviewsYR: 2005NO: 4PB: John Wiley & Sons, LtdKY: Chronic Disease [psychology] [therapy];Adaptation, Psychological;Computer-Assisted Instruction [methods];Decision Making;Health Education [methods];Internet;Patient Education as Topic [methods] [standards];Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic;Self Care;Self Efficacy;Social Support;Humans[checkword]CC: COMMUNDOI: 10.1002/14651858.CD004274.pub4AB: Background: Interactive Health Communication Applications (IHCAs) are computer-based, usually web-based, information packages for patients that combine health information with at least one of social support, decision support, or behaviour change support. These are innovations in health care and their effects on health are uncertain.Objectives: To assess the effects of IHCAs for people with chronic disease.Search methods: We designed a four-part search strategy. First, we searched electronic bibliographic databases for published work; second, we searched the grey literature; and third, we searched for ongoing and recently completed clinical trials in the appropriate databases. Finally, researchers of included studies were contacted, and reference lists from relevant primary and review articles were followed up. As IHCAs require relatively new technology, the search time period commenced at 1990, where possible, and ran until 31 December 2003.Selection criteria: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of IHCAs for adults and children with chronic disease.Data collection and analysis: One review author screened abstracts for relevance. Two review authors screened all candidate studies to determine eligibility, apply quality criteria, and extract data from included studies. Authors of included RCTs were contacted for missing data. Results of RCTs were pooled using random-effects model with standardised mean differences (SMDs) for continuous outcomes and odds ratios for binary outcomes; heterogeneity was assessed using the I2 statistic.Main results: We identified 24 RCTs involving 3739 participants which were included in the review.IHCAs had a significant positive effect on knowledge (SMD 0.46; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.22 to 0.69), social support (SMD 0.35; 95% CI 0.18 to 0.52) and clinical outcomes (SMD 0.18; 95% CI 0.01 to 0.35). Results suggest it is more likely than not that IHCAs have a positive effect on self-efficacy (a person's belief in their capacity to carry out a specific action) (SMD 0.24; 95% CI 0.00 to 0.48). IHCAs had a significant positive effect on continuous behavioural outcomes (SMD 0.20; 95% CI 0.01 to 0.40). Binary behavioural outcomes also showed a positive effect for IHCAs, although this result was not statistically significant (OR 1.66; 95% CI 0.71 to 3.87). It was not possible to determine the effects of IHCAs on emotional or economic outcomes.Authors' conclusions: IHCAs appear to have largely positive effects on users, in that users tend to become more knowledgeable, feel better socially supported, and may have improved behavioural and clinical outcomes compared to non-users. There is a need for more high quality studies with large sample sizes to confirm these preliminary findings, to determine the best type and best way to deliver IHCAs, and to establish how IHCAs have their effects for different groups of people with chronic illness.US: http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD004274.pub4/abstractRecord #253 of 271ID: CD009927AU: MacArthur GeorginaAU: Kipping RuthAU: White JamesAU: Chittleborough CatherineAU: Lingam RaghuAU: Pasch KerynAU: Gunnell DavidAU: Hickman MatthewAU: Campbell RonaTI: Individual-, family-, and school-level interventions for preventing multiple risk behaviours in individuals aged 8 to 25 yearsSO: Cochrane Database of Systematic ReviewsYR: 2012NO: 6PB: John Wiley & Sons, LtdCC: PUBHLTHDOI: 10.1002/14651858.CD009927AB: : This is the protocol for a review and there is no abstract. The objectives are as follows:Primary research objective: To review the effects of interventions implemented up to 18 years of age for the primary or secondary prevention of multiple risk behaviours in individuals aged 8-25 years.In this review, multiple risk behaviours are considered as two or more behaviours, but interventions that address certain combinations of behaviours are excluded to avoid overlap with other reviews. These include those that target just two behaviours including unhealthy diet, low levels of physical activity and/or high levels of sedentary behaviour; and those that target a combination of tobacco use, alcohol consumption and/or drug use (see the types of interventions section).Secondary research objectives: To explore whether the effects of the intervention differ within and between population subgroups. To explore whether the effects of the intervention differ by risk behaviour and by outcomes. To explore the influence of the setting of the intervention in the design, delivery and outcomes of the interventions. To explore the relationship between the number and/or types of component(s) of an intervention, duration, and effects of the interventions. To explore whether the impact(s) of interventions differ according to whether behaviours are addressed simultaneously or sequentially and/or whether behaviours are addressed in a particular order. To explore the association between clustering of particular behaviours and the effects of the interventions. To explore the cost-effectiveness of interventions.

For decades, innovations in the field of haemorrhoidal treatment have centred on modifying the traditional methods to achieve a minimally invasive, less painful procedure and yet with a more sustainable result. The availability of newer techniques has reopened debate on the roles of traditional treatment options for haemorrhoids.Objectives: To review the efficacy and safety of the two most popular conventional methods of haemorrhoidal treatment, rubber band ligation and excisional haemorrhoidectomy. The original study has now been up dated using the same search strategy.Search methods: We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, CENTRAL, and CINAHL October 2010Selection criteria: Randomised controlled trials comparing rubber band ligation with excisional haemorrhoidectomy for symptomatic haemorrhoids in adult human patients were included.Data collection and analysis: We extracted data on to previously designed data extraction sheet. Dichtomous data were presented as relative risk and 95% confidence intervals, and continuous outcomes as weighted mean difference and 95% confidence intervals.Main results: Three trials (of poor methodological quality) met the inclusion criteria. Complete remission of haemorrhoidal symptom was better with excisional haemorrhoidectomy (EH) (three studies, 202 patients, RR 1.68, 95% CI 1.00 to 2.83). There was significant heterogeneity between the studies (I2 = 90.5%; P = 0.0001). Similar analysis based on the grading of haemorrhoids revealed the superiority of EH over RBL for grade III haemorrhoids (prolapse that needs manual reduction) (two trials, 116 patients, RR 1.23, CI 1.04 to 1.45; P = 0.01). However, no significant difference was noticed in grade II haemorrhoids (prolapse that reduces spontaneously on cessation of straining) (one trial, 32 patients, RR 1.07, CI 0.94 to 1.21; P = 0.32) Fewer patients required re-treatment after EH (three trials, RR 0.20 CI 0.09 to 0.40; P < 0.00001). Patients undergoing EH were at significantly higher risk of postoperative pain (three trials, fixed effect; 212 patients, RR 1.94, 95% CI 1.62 to 2.33, P < 0.00001). The overall delayed complication rate showed significant difference (P = 0.03) (three trials, 204 patients, RR 6.32, CI 1.15 to 34.89) between the two interventions.Authors' conclusions: The present systematic review confirms the long-term efficacy of EH, at least for grade III haemorrhoids, compared to the less invasive technique of RBL but at the expense of increased pain, higher complications and more time off work. However, despite these disadvantages of EH, patient satisfaction and patient's acceptance of the treatment modalities seems to be similar following both the techniques implying patient's preference for complete long-term cure of symptoms and possibly less concern for minor complications. So, RBL can be adopted as the choice of treatment for grade II haemorrhoids with similar results but with out the side effects of EH while reserving EH for grade III haemorrhoids or recurrence after RBL. More robust study is required to make definitive conclusions.One additional study was identified from the updated search (Ali 2005). However, after careful review and discussion among the authors, it was decided that this study did not meet the necessary criteria for including in the analysis. Hence, the results and conclusion remains the same.US: http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD005034.pub2/abstractRecord #255 of 271ID: CD004183AU: Bjelakovic GoranAU: Nikolova DimitrinkaAU: Simonetti Rosa GAU: Gluud ChristianTI: Antioxidant supplements for preventing gastrointestinal cancersSO: Cochrane Database of Systematic ReviewsYR: 2008NO: 3PB: John Wiley & Sons, LtdKY: Dietary Supplements [adverse effects];Antioxidants [administration & dosage] [adverse effects];Gastrointestinal Neoplasms [mortality] [prevention & control];Liver Neoplasms [mortality] [prevention & control];Pancreatic Neoplasms [mortality] [prevention & control];Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic;Humans[checkword]CC: LIVERDOI: 10.1002/14651858.CD004183.pub3AB: Background: Oxidative stress may cause gastrointestinal cancers. The evidence on whether antioxidant supplements are effective in preventing gastrointestinal cancers is contradictory.Objectives: To assess the beneficial and harmful effects of antioxidant supplements in preventing gastrointestinal cancers.Search methods: We identified trials through the trials registers of the four Cochrane Review Groups on gastrointestinal diseases, The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials in The Cochrane Library (Issue 2, 2007), MEDLINE, EMBASE, LILACS, SCI-EXPANDED, and The Chinese Biomedical Database from inception to October 2007. We scanned reference lists and contacted pharmaceutical companies.Selection criteria: Randomised trials comparing antioxidant supplements to placebo/no intervention examining occurrence of gastrointestinal cancers.Data collection and analysis: Two authors (GB and DN) independently selected trials for inclusion and extracted data. Outcome measures were gastrointestinal cancers, overall mortality, and adverse effects. Outcomes were reported as relative risks (RR) with 95% confidence interval (CI) based on random-effects and fixed-effect model meta-analysis. Meta-regression assessed the effect of covariates across the trials.Main results: We identified 20 randomised trials (211,818 participants), assessing beta-carotene (12 trials), vitamin A (4 trials), vitamin C (8 trials), vitamin E (10 trials), and selenium (9 trials). Trials quality was generally high. Heterogeneity was low to moderate. Antioxidant supplements were without significant effects on gastrointestinal cancers (RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.83 to 1.06). However, there was significant heterogeneity (I2 = 54.0%, P = 0.003). The heterogeneity may have been explained by bias risk (low-bias risk trials RR 1.04, 95% CI 0.96 to 1.13 compared to high-bias risk trials RR 0.59, 95% CI 0.43 to 0.80; test of interaction P < 0.0005), and type of antioxidant supplement (beta-carotene potentially increasing and selenium potentially decreasing cancer risk). The antioxidant supplements had no significant effects on mortality in a random-effects model meta-analysis (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.97 to 1.07, I2 = 53.5%), but significantly increased mortality in a fixed-effect model meta-analysis (RR 1.04, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.07). Beta-carotene in combination with vitamin A (RR 1.16, 95% CI 1.09 to 1.23) and vitamin E (RR 1.06, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.11) significantly increased mortality. Increased yellowing of the skin and belching were non-serious adverse effects of beta-carotene. In five trials (four with high risk of bias), selenium seemed to show significant beneficial effect on gastrointestinal cancer occurrence (RR 0.59, 95% CI 0.46 to 0.75, I2 = 0%).Authors' conclusions: We could not find convincing evidence that antioxidant supplements prevent gastrointestinal cancers. On the contrary, antioxidant supplements seem to increase overall mortality. The potential cancer preventive effect of selenium should be tested in adequately conducted randomised trials.US: http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD004183.pub3/abstractRecord #256 of 271ID: CD011967AU: Brown JulieAU: Martis RuthAU: Hughes BrendaAU: Rowan JanetAU: Crowther Caroline ATI: Oral anti-diabetic pharmacological therapies for the treatment of women with gestational diabetesSO: Cochrane Database of Systematic ReviewsYR: 2017NO: 1PB: John Wiley & Sons, LtdDOI: 10.1002/14651858.CD011967.pub2AB: Background: Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is a major public health issue with rates increasing globally. Gestational diabetes, glucose intolerance first recognised during pregnancy, usually resolves after birth and is associated with short- and long-term complications for the mother and her infant. Treatment options can include oral anti-diabetic pharmacological therapies.Objectives: To evaluate the effects of oral anti-diabetic pharmacological therapies for treating women with GDM.Search methods: We searched Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth's Trials Register (14 May 2016), ClinicalTrials.gov, WHO ICTRP (14 May 2016) and reference lists of retrieved studies.Selection criteria: We included published and unpublished randomised controlled trials assessing the effects of oral anti-diabetic pharmacological therapies for treating pregnant women with GDM. We included studies comparing oral anti-diabetic pharmacological therapies with 1) placebo/standard care, 2) another oral anti-diabetic pharmacological therapy, 3) combined oral anti-diabetic pharmacological therapies. Trials using insulin as the comparator were excluded as they are the subject of a separate Cochrane systematic review.Women with pre-existing type 1 or type 2 diabetes were excluded.Data collection and analysis: Two review authors independently assessed trials for inclusion and trial quality. Two review authors independently extracted data and data were checked for accuracy.Main results: We included 11 studies (19 publications) (1487 women and their babies). Eight studies had data that could be included in meta-analyses. Studies were conducted in Brazil, India, Israel, UK, South Africa and USA. The studies varied in diagnostic criteria and treatment targets for glycaemic control for GDM. The overall risk of bias was 'unclear' due to inadequate reporting of methodology. Using GRADE the quality of the evidence ranged from moderate to very low quality. Evidence was downgraded for risk of bias (reporting bias, lack of blinding), inconsistency, indirectness, imprecision and for oral anti-diabetic therapy versus placebo for generalisability. Oral anti-diabetic pharmacological therapies versus placebo/standard careThere was no evidence of a difference between glibenclamide and placebo groups for hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (risk ratio (RR) 1.24, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.81 to 1.90; one study, 375 women, very low-quality evidence), birth by caesarean section (RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.79 to 1.34; one study, 375 women, very low-quality evidence), perineal trauma (RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.06 to 15.62; one study, 375 women, very low-quality evidence) or induction of labour (RR 1.18, 95% CI 0.79 to 1.76; one study, 375 women; very low-quality evidence). No data were reported for development of type 2 diabetes or other pre-specified GRADE maternal outcomes (return to pre-pregnancy weight, postnatal depression). For the infant, there was no evidence of a difference in the risk of being born large-for-gestational age (LGA) between infants whose mothers had been treated with glibenclamide and those in the placebo group (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.51 to 1.58; one study, 375, low-quality evidence). No data were reported for other infant primary or GRADE outcomes (perinatal mortality, death or serious morbidity composite, neurosensory disability in later childhood, neonatal hypoglycaemia, adiposity, diabetes). Metformin versus glibenclamideThere was no evidence of a difference between metformin- and glibenclamide-treated groups for the risk of hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (RR 0.70, 95% CI 0.38 to 1.30; three studies, 508 women, moderate-quality evidence), birth by caesarean section (average RR 1.20, 95% CI 1.20; 95% CI 0.83 to 1.72, four studies, 554 women, I2 = 61%, Tau2 = 0.07 low-quality evidence), induction of labour (0.81, 95% CI 0.61 to 1.07; one study, 159 women; low-quality evidence) or perineal trauma (RR 1.67, 95% CI 0.22 to 12.52; two studies, 158 women; low-quality evidence). No data were reported for development of type 2 diabetes or other pre-specified GRADE maternal outcomes (return to pre-pregnancy weight, postnatal depression). For the infant there was no evidence of a difference between the metformin- and glibenclamide-exposed groups for the risk of being born LGA (average RR 0.67, 95% CI 0.24 to 1.83; two studies, 246 infants, I2 = 54%, Tau2 = 0.30 low-quality evidence). Metformin was associated with a decrease in a death or serious morbidity composite (RR 0.54, 95% CI 0.31 to 0.94; one study, 159 infants, low-quality evidence). There was no clear difference between groups for neonatal hypoglycaemia (RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.42 to 1.77; four studies, 554 infants, low-quality evidence) or perinatal mortality (RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.06 to 14.55, two studies, 359 infants). No data were reported for neurosensory disability in later childhood or for adiposity or diabetes. Glibenclamide versus acarboseThere was no evidence of a difference between glibenclamide and acarbose from one study (43 women) for any of their maternal or infant primary outcomes (caesarean section, RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.53 to 1.70; low-quality evidence; perinatal mortality - no events; low-quality evidence; LGA , RR 2.38, 95% CI 0.54 to 10.46; low-quality evidence). There was no evidence of a difference between glibenclamide and acarbose for neonatal hypoglycaemia (RR 6.33, 95% CI 0.87 to 46.32; low-quality evidence). There were no data reported for other pre-specified GRADE or primary maternal outcomes (hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, development of type 2 diabetes, perineal trauma, return to pre-pregnancy weight, postnatal depression, induction of labour) or neonatal outcomes (death or serious morbidity composite, adiposity or diabetes).Authors' conclusions: There were insufficient data comparing oral anti-diabetic pharmacological therapies with placebo/standard care (lifestyle advice) to inform clinical practice. There was insufficient high-quality evidence to be able to draw any meaningful conclusions as to the benefits of one oral anti-diabetic pharmacological therapy over another due to limited reporting of data for the primary and secondary outcomes in this review. Short- and long-term clinical outcomes for this review were inadequately reported or not reported. Current choice of oral anti-diabetic pharmacological therapy appears to be based on clinical preference, availability and national clinical practice guidelines.The benefits and potential harms of one oral anti-diabetic pharmacological therapy compared with another, or compared with placebo/standard care remains unclear and requires further research. Future trials should attempt to report on the core outcomes suggested in this review, in particular long-term outcomes for the woman and the infant that have been poorly reported to date, women's experiences and cost benefit.US: http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD011967.pub2/abstractRecord #257 of 271ID: CD009128AU: Ooi Cheow PengAU: Loke Seng CheongTI: Sweet potato for type 2 diabetes mellitusSO: Cochrane Database of Systematic ReviewsYR: 2013NO: 9PB: John Wiley & Sons, LtdKY: Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2 [blood] [drug therapy];Hemoglobin A, Glycosylated [metabolism];Ipomoea batatas [chemistry];Phytotherapy [methods];Plant Extracts [therapeutic use];Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic;Female[checkword];Humans[checkword];Male[checkword]CC: ENDOCDOI: 10.1002/14651858.CD009128.pub3AB: Background: Sweet potato (Ipomoea batatas) is among the most nutritious subtropical and tropical vegetables. It is also used in traditional medicine practices for type 2 diabetes mellitus. Research in animal and human models suggests a possible role of sweet potato in glycaemic control.Objectives: To assess the effects of sweet potato for type 2 diabetes mellitus.Search methods: We searched several electronic databases, including The Cochrane Library (2013, Issue 1), MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, SIGLE and LILACS (all up to February 2013), combined with handsearches. No language restrictions were used.Selection criteria: We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared sweet potato with a placebo or a comparator intervention, with or without pharmacological or non-pharmacological interventions.Data collection and analysis: Two authors independently selected the trials and extracted the data. We evaluated risk of bias by assessing randomisation, allocation concealment, blinding, completeness of outcome data, selective reporting and other potential sources of bias.Main results: Three RCTs met our inclusion criteria: these investigated a total of 140 participants and ranged from six weeks to five months in duration. All three studies were performed by the same trialist. Overall, the risk of bias of these trials was unclear or high. All RCTs compared the effect of sweet potato preparations with placebo on glycaemic control in type 2 diabetes mellitus. There was a statistically significant improvement in glycosylated haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) at three to five months with 4 g/day sweet potato preparation compared to placebo (mean difference -0.3% (95% confidence interval -0.6 to -0.04); P = 0.02; 122 participants; 2 trials). No serious adverse effects were reported. Diabetic complications and morbidity, death from any cause, health-related quality of life, well-being, functional outcomes and costs were not investigated.Authors' conclusions: There is insufficient evidence about the use of sweet potato for type 2 diabetes mellitus. In addition to improvement in trial methodology, issues of standardization and quality control of preparations - including other varieties of sweet potato - need to be addressed. Further observational trials and RCTs evaluating the effects of sweet potato are needed to guide any recommendations in clinical practice.US: http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD009128.pub3/abstractRecord #258 of 271ID: CD012151AU: Hemmingsen BiancaAU: Sonne David PeickAU: Metzendorf Maria-IntiAU: Richter BerndTI: Insulin secretagogues for prevention or delay of type 2 diabetes mellitus and its associated complications in persons at increased risk for the development of type 2 diabetes mellitusSO: Cochrane Database of Systematic ReviewsYR: 2016NO: 10PB: John Wiley & Sons, LtdKY: Benzamides [therapeutic use];Blood Glucose [analysis];Cardiovascular Diseases [mortality];Cyclohexanes [adverse effects] [therapeutic use];Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2 [blood] [mortality] [prevention & control];Fasting [blood];Hypoglycemic Agents [adverse effects] [therapeutic use];Insulin [secretion];Metformin [therapeutic use];Phenylalanine [adverse effects] [analogs & derivatives] [therapeutic use];Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic;Sulfonylurea Compounds [adverse effects] [therapeutic use];Adult[checkword];Humans[checkword];Middle Aged[checkword]DOI: 10.1002/14651858.CD012151.pub2AB: Background: The projected rise in the incidence of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) could develop into a substantial health problem worldwide. Whether insulin secretagogues (sulphonylureas and meglitinide analogues) are able to prevent or delay T2DM and its associated complications in people at risk for the development of T2DM is unknown.Objectives: To assess the effects of insulin secretagogues on the prevention or delay of T2DM and its associated complications in people with impaired glucose tolerance, impaired fasting blood glucose, moderately elevated glycosylated haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) or any combination of these.Search methods: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, PubMed, Embase, ClinicalTrials.gov, the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, and the reference lists of systematic reviews, articles and health technology assessment reports. We asked investigators of the included trials for information about additional trials. The date of the last search of all databases was April 2016.Selection criteria: We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) with a duration of 12 weeks or more comparing insulin secretagogues with any pharmacological glucose-lowering intervention, behaviour-changing intervention, placebo or no intervention in people with impaired fasting glucose, impaired glucose tolerance, moderately elevated HbA1c or combinations of these.Data collection and analysis: Two review authors read all abstracts and full-text articles/records, assessed quality and extracted outcome data independently. One review author extracted data which were checked by a second review author. We resolved discrepancies by consensus or the involvement of a third review author. For meta-analyses we used a random-effects model with investigation of risk ratios (RRs) for dichotomous outcomes and mean differences (MDs) for continuous outcomes, using 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for effect estimates. We carried out trial sequential analyses (TSAs) for all outcomes that could be meta-analysed. We assessed the overall quality of the evidence by using the GRADE instrument.Main results: We included six RCTs with 10,018 participants; 4791 participants with data on allocation to intervention groups were randomised to a second- or third-generation sulphonylurea or a meglitinide analogue as monotherapy and 29 participants were randomised to a second-generation sulphonylurea plus metformin. Three trials investigated a second-generation sulphonylurea, two trials investigated a third-generation sulphonylurea and one trial a meglitinide analogue. A total of 4873 participants with data on allocation to control groups were randomised to a comparator group; 4820 participants were randomised to placebo, 23 to diet and exercise, and 30 participants to metformin monotherapy. One RCT of nateglinide contributed 95% of all participants. The duration of the intervention varied from six months to five years. We judged none of the included trials as at low risk of bias for all 'Risk of bias' domains.All-cause and cardiovascular mortality following sulphonylurea (glimepiride) treatment were rarely observed (very low-quality evidence). The RR for incidence of T2DM comparing glimepiride monotherapy with placebo was 0.75; 95% CI 0.54 to 1.04; P = 0.08; 2 trials; 307 participants; very low-quality evidence. One of the trials reporting on the incidence of T2DM did not define the diagnostic criteria used. The other trial diagnosed T2DM as two consecutive fasting blood glucose values ≥ 6.1 mmol/L. TSA showed that only 4.5% of the diversity-adjusted required information size was accrued so far. No trial reported data on serious adverse events, non-fatal myocardial infarction (MI), non-fatal stroke, congestive heart failure (HF), health-related quality of life or socioeconomic effects.One trial with a follow-up of five years compared a meglitinide analogue (nateglinide) with placebo. A total of 310/4645 (6.7%) participants allocated to nateglinide died compared with 312/4661 (6.7%) participants allocated to placebo (hazard ratio (HR) 1.00; 95% CI 0.85 to 1.17; P = 0.98; moderate-quality evidence). The two main criteria for diagnosing T2DM were a fasting plasma glucose level ≥ 7.0 mmol/L or a 2-hour post challenge glucose ≥ 11.1 mmol/L. T2DM developed in 1674/4645 (36.0%) participants in the nateglinide group and in 1580/4661 (33.9%) in the placebo group (HR 1.07; 95% CI 1.00 to 1.15; P = 0.05; moderate-quality evidence). One or more serious adverse event was reported in 2066/4602 (44.9%) participants allocated to nateglinide compared with 2089/4599 (45.6%) participants allocated to placebo. A total of 126/4645 (2.7%) participants allocated to nateglinide died because of cardiovascular disease compared with 118/4661 (2.5%) participants allocated to placebo (HR 1.07; 95% CI 0.83 to 1.38; P = 0.60; moderate-quality evidence). Comparing participants receiving nateglinide with those receiving placebo for the outcomes MI, non-fatal stroke and HF gave the following event rates: MI 116/4645 (2.5%) versus 122/4661 (2.6%), stroke 100/4645 (2.2%) versus 110/4661 (2.4%) and numbers hospitalised for HF 85/4645 (1.8%) versus 100/4661 (2.1%) - (HR 0.85; 95% CI 0.64 to 1.14; P = 0.27). The quality of the evidence was moderate for all these outcomes. Health-related quality of life or socioeconomic effects were not reported.Authors' conclusions: There is insufficient evidence to demonstrate whether insulin secretagogues compared mainly with placebo reduce the risk of developing T2DM and its associated complications in people at increased risk for the development of T2DM. Most trials did not investigate patient-important outcomes.US: http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD012151.pub2/abstractRecord #259 of 271ID: CD009678AU: Cohen Jennifer EAU: Wakefield Claire EAU: Cohn Richard JTI: Nutritional interventions for survivors of childhood cancerSO: Cochrane Database of Systematic ReviewsYR: 2016NO: 8PB: John Wiley & Sons, LtdKY: Health Behavior;Neoplasms [therapy];Survivors;Bone Density;Calcium, Dietary [administration & dosage];Cardiovascular Diseases [prevention & control];Endocrine System Diseases [prevention & control];Fast Foods;Intention to Treat Analysis;Metabolic Syndrome X [prevention & control];Milk;Nutrition Therapy [methods];Osteoporosis [prevention & control];Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma [therapy];Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic;Vitamin D [administration & dosage];Vitamins [administration & dosage];Adolescent[checkword];Animals[checkword];Child[checkword];Humans[checkword];Young Adult[checkword]DOI: 10.1002/14651858.CD009678.pub2AB: Background: Childhood cancer survivors are at a higher risk of developing health conditions such as osteoporosis, and cardiovascular disease than their peers. Health-promoting behaviour, such as consuming a healthy diet, could lessen the impact of these chronic issues, yet the prevalence rate of health-protecting behaviour amongst survivors of childhood cancer is similar to that of the general population. Targeted nutritional interventions may prevent or reduce the incidence of these chronic diseases.Objectives: The primary aim of this review was to assess the efficacy of a range of nutritional interventions designed to improve the nutritional intake of childhood cancer survivors, as compared to a control group of childhood cancer survivors who did not receive the intervention. Secondary objectives were to assess metabolic and cardiovascular risk factors, measures of weight and body fat distribution, behavioural change, changes in knowledge regarding disease risk and nutritional intake, participants' views of the intervention, measures of health status and quality of life, measures of harm associated with the process or outcomes of the intervention, and cost-effectiveness of the interventionSearch methods: We searched the electronic databases of the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2013, Issue 3), MEDLINE/PubMed (from 1945 to April 2013), and Embase/Ovid (from 1980 to April 2013). We ran the search again in August 2015; we have not yet fully assessed these results, but we have identified one ongoing trial. We conducted additional searching of ongoing trial registers - the International Standard Randomised Controlled Trial Number register and the National Institutes of Health register (both screened in the first half of 2013) - reference lists of relevant articles and reviews, and conference proceedings of the International Society for Paediatric Oncology and the International Conference on Long-Term Complications of Treatment of Children and Adolescents for Cancer (both 2008 to 2012).Selection criteria: We included all randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared the effects of a nutritional intervention with a control group which did not receive the intervention in this review. Participants were childhood cancer survivors of any age, diagnosed with any type of cancer when less than 18 years of age. Participating childhood cancer survivors had completed their treatment with curative intent prior to the intervention.Data collection and analysis: Two review authors independently selected and extracted data from each identified study, using a standardised form. We assessed the validity of each identified study using the criteria outlined in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions. We used the GRADE criteria to assess the quality of each trial.Main results: Three RCTs were eligible for review. A total of 616 participants were included in the analysis. One study included participants who had been treated for acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) (275 participants). Two studies included participants who had all forms of paediatric malignancies (266 and 75 participants). All participants were less than 21 years of age at study entry. The follow-up ranged from one month to 36 months from the initial assessment. All intended outcomes were not evaluated by each included study. All studies looked at different interventions, and so we were unable to pool results. We could not rule out the presence of bias in any of the studies.There was no clear evidence of a difference in calcium intake at one month between those who received the single, half-day, group-based education that focused on bone health, and those who received standard care (mean difference (MD) 111.60, 95% confidence interval (CI) -258.97 to 482.17; P = 0.56, low quality evidence). A regression analysis, adjusting for baseline calcium intake and changes in knowledge and self-efficacy, showed a significantly greater calcium intake for the intervention as compared with the control group at the one-month follow-up (beta coefficient 4.92, 95% CI 0.33 to 9.52; P = 0.04). There was statistically significant higher, self-reported milk consumption (MD 0.43, 95% CI 0.07 to 0.79; P = 0.02, low quality evidence), number of days on calcium supplementation (MD 11.42, 95% CI 7.11 to 15.73; P < 0.00001, low quality evidence), and use of any calcium supplementation (risk ratio (RR) 3.35, 95% CI 1.86 to 6.04; P < 0.0001, low quality evidence), with those who received this single, face-to-face, group-based, health behaviour session.There was no clear evidence of a difference in bone density Z-scores measured with a dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) scan at 36 months follow-up (MD -0.05, 95% CI -0.26 to 0.16; P = 0.64, moderate quality evidence) between those who received calcium and vitamin D supplementation combined with nutrition education and those who received nutrition education alone. There was also no clear evidence of a difference in bone mineral density between the intervention and the control group at the 12-month (median difference -0.17, P = 0.99) and 24-month follow-up (median difference -0.04, P = 0.54).A single multi-component health behaviour change intervention, focusing on general healthy eating principles, with two telephone follow-ups brought about a 0.17 lower score on the four-point Likert scale of self-reported junk food intake compared with the control group (MD -0.17, 95% CI -0.33 to -0.01; P = 0.04, low quality evidence); this result was statistically significant. There was no clear evidence of a difference between the groups in the self-reported use of nutrition as a health protective behaviour (MD -0.05, 95% CI -0.24 to 0.14; P = 0.60, low quality evidence).Authors' conclusions: Due to a paucity of studies, and the heterogeneity of the studies included in this review, we are unable to draw conclusions regarding the effectiveness of nutritional interventions for use with childhood cancer survivors. Although there is low quality evidence for the improvement in health behaviours using health behaviour change interventions, there remains no evidence as to whether this translates into an improvement in dietary intake. There was also no evidence that the studies reduced the risk of cardiovascular and metabolic disorders in childhood cancer survivors, although no evidence of effect is not the same as evidence of no effect. This review highlights the need for further well designed trials to be implemented in this population.US: http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD009678.pub2/abstractRecord #260 of 271ID: CD001257AU: Irving Claire BAU: Mumby-Croft RogerAU: Joy L ATI: Polyunsaturated fatty acid supplementation for schizophreniaSO: Cochrane Database of Systematic ReviewsYR: 2006NO: 3PB: John Wiley & Sons, LtdKY: Dietary Supplements;Antipsychotic Agents [therapeutic use];Drug Therapy, Combination;Fatty Acids, Unsaturated [therapeutic use];Fish Oils [therapeutic use];Plant Oils [therapeutic use];Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic;Schizophrenia [diet therapy] [drug therapy];Humans[checkword]CC: SCHIZDOI: 10.1002/14651858.CD001257.pub2AB: Background: Limited evidence supports a hypothesis suggesting that the symptoms of schizophrenia may be the result of altered neuronal membrane structure and metabolism. The structure and metabolism is dependent on blood plasma levels of certain essential fatty acids and their metabolites.Objectives: To assess the effects of polyunsaturated fatty acids for people with schizophrenia.Search methods: We have updated the initial searches of 1998, 2002 and 2005 with a search of the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group's Register, November 2008, which is based on regular searches of CINAHL, EMBASE, MEDLINE and PsycINFO.Where necessary, we contacted authors and relevant pharmaceutical companies for additional information.Selection criteria: We included all randomised controlled trials of polyunsaturated fatty acid treatment for schizophrenia.Data collection and analysis: Working independently, we selected studies for quality assessment and extracted relevant data. We analysed on an intention-to-treat basis. Where possible and appropriate we calculated the Relative Risk (RR) and their 95% confidence intervals (CI) and estimated the number needed to treat (NNT). For continuous data we calculated weighted mean differences (WMD) and their 95% confidence intervals. We also inspected the data for heterogeneity.Main results: Eight studies are now included in this review. When any dose omega-3 (E-EPA or EPA) is compared with placebo, small short trials suggest that the need for neuroleptics appears to be reduced for people allocated omega-3 supplementation (n=30, 1 RCT, RR 0.73 CI 0.54 to 1.00) and mental state may improve (n=30, 1 RCT, RR not gaining 25% change in PANSS scores 0.54 CI 0.30 to 0.96, NNT 3 CI 2 to 29). There are no differences in the number of people leaving the study early (n=595, 6 RCTs, RR 0.86 CI 0.50 to 1.48). There are few data on the comparison of any dose omega-6 (GLA) with placebo. For movement disorder outcomes, the one small study we found does not show any difference for average short-term endpoint AIMS score (n=16, 1 RCT, WMD 1.30 CI -1.96 to 4.56). When any dose omega-3 (E-EPA or EPA) is compared with any dose omega-3 (DHA) there is no significant difference for mental state outcome of not gaining 25% change in PANSS scores (n=31, 1 RCT, RR 0.66 CI 0.39 to 1.11). When different doses of omega-3 (E-EPA) are compared with placebo there are no differences in measures of global and mental state between the studies. For the outcome of 'experiencing at least one adverse effect' no differences between groups are found for any dose (1 g/day E-EPA vs placebo n=63, 1 RCT, RR 0.97 CI 0.60 to 1.56; 2 g/day E-EPA vs placebo n=63, 1 RCT, RR 0.67 CI 0.37 to 1.20; 4 g/day E-EPA vs placebo n=58, 1 RCT, RR 1.15 CI 0.72 to 1.82).Authors' conclusions: Three updates of this review have resulted in more included studies and more people randomised but still relatively little useful additional data. The results remain inconclusive. The new trials all compare the omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids, in particular eicosapentaenoic acid and its ester, ethyl-eicosapentaenoic acid. The use of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids for schizophrenia still remains experimental and this review highlights the need for large, well designed, conducted and reported studies.US: http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD001257.pub2/abstractRecord #261 of 271ID: CD010522AU: Yepes-Nuñez Juan JoseAU: Zhang YuanAU: Roqué i Figuls MartaAU: Bartra Tomas JoanAU: Reyes Juan ManuelAU: Pineda de la Losa FernandoAU: Enrique ErnestoTI: Immunotherapy (oral and sublingual) for food allergy to fruitsSO: Cochrane Database of Systematic ReviewsYR: 2015NO: 11PB: John Wiley & Sons, LtdKY: Desensitization, Immunologic [methods];Food Hypersensitivity [etiology] [therapy];Fruit [adverse effects];Malus [adverse effects];Pyrus [adverse effects];Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic;Sublingual Immunotherapy [methods];Adult[checkword];Humans[checkword]DOI: 10.1002/14651858.CD010522.pub2AB: Background: Food allergy is an abnormal immunological response following exposure (usually ingestion) to a food. Elimination of the allergen is the principle treatment for food allergy, including allergy to fruit. Accidental ingestion of allergenic foods can result in severe anaphylactic reactions. Allergen-specific immunotherapy (SIT) is a specific treatment, when the avoidance of allergenic foods is problematic. Recently, studies have been conducted on different types of immunotherapy for the treatment of food allergy, including oral (OIT) and sublingual immunotherapy (SLIT).Objectives: To determine the efficacy and safety of oral and sublingual immunotherapy in children and adults with food allergy to fruits, when compared with placebo or an elimination strategy.Search methods: The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, and AMED were searched for published results along with trial registries and the Journal of Negative Results in BioMedicine for grey literature. The date of the most recent search was July 2015.Selection criteria: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing OIT or SLIT with placebo or an elimination diet were included. Participants were children or adults diagnosed with food allergy who presented immediate fruit reactions.Data collection and analysis: We used standard methodological procedures expected by the Cochrane Collaboration. We assessed treatment effect through risk ratios (RRs) for dichotomous outcomes.Main results: We identified two RCTs (N=89) eligible for inclusion. These RCTs addressed oral or sublingual immunotherapy, both in adults, with an allergy to apple or peach respectively. Both studies enrolled a small number of participants and used different methods to provide these differing types of immunotherapy. Both studies were judged to be at high risk of bias in at least one domain. Overall, the quality of evidence was judged to be very low due to the small number of studies and participants and possible bias. The studies were clinically heterogeneous and hence we did not pool the results. A study comparing SLIT with placebo for allergy to peach did not detect a significant difference between the number of patients desensitised at six months following a double-blind placebo-controlled food challenge (RR 1.16, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.49 to 2.74). The second study, comparing OIT versus no treatment for apple allergy, found an effect on desensitisation in favour of the intervention using an oral provocation test at eight months, but results were imprecise (RR 17.50, 95% CI 1.13 to 270.19). Neither study reported data on evidence of immunologic tolerance. In both studies, the incidence of mild and moderate adverse events was higher in the intervention groups than in the controls. In the study comparing SLIT with placebo, patients in the intervention group experienced significantly more local adverse reactions than participants in the control group (RR 3.21, 95% CI 1.51 to 6.82), though there was not a significant difference in the number of participants experiencing systemic adverse reactions (RR 0.81, 95% CI 0.22 to 3.02). In the study of OIT, two of the 25 participants in the intervention group reported relevant side effects, whereas no participants in the control group reported relevant side effects.Authors' conclusions: There is insufficient evidence for using OIT or SLIT to treat allergy to fruit, specifically related to peach and apple. Mild or moderate adverse reactions were reported more frequently in people receiving OIT or SLIT. However, these reactions could be treated successfully with medications.US: http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD010522.pub2/abstractRecord #262 of 271ID: CD005200AU: Vennix SandraAU: Pelzers LoekiAU: Bouvy NicoleAU: Beets Geerard L.AU: Pierie Jean-PierreAU: Wiggers TheoAU: Breukink StephanieTI: Laparoscopic versus open total mesorectal excision for rectal cancerSO: Cochrane Database of Systematic ReviewsYR: 2014NO: 4PB: John Wiley & Sons, LtdKY: Laparoscopy;Conversion to Open Surgery [statistics & numerical data];Elective Surgical Procedures;Rectal Neoplasms [surgery];Rectum [surgery];Treatment Outcome;Humans[checkword]DOI: 10.1002/14651858.CD005200.pub3AB: Background: Colorectal cancer including rectal cancer is the third most common cause of cancer deaths in the western world. For colon carcinoma, laparoscopic surgery is proven to result in faster postoperative recovery, fewer complications and better cosmetic results with equal oncologic results. These short-term benefits are expected to be similar for laparoscopic rectal cancer surgery. However, the oncological safety of laparoscopic surgery for rectal cancer remained controversial due to the lack of definitive long-term results. Thus, the expected short-term benefits can only be of interest when oncological results are at least equal.Objectives: To evaluate the differences in short- and long-term results after elective laparoscopic total mesorectal excision (LTME) for the resection of rectal cancer compared with open total mesorectal excision (OTME).Search methods: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, The Cochrane Library 2013, Issue 2), MEDLINE (January 1990 to February 2013), EMBASE (January 1990 to February 2013), ClinicalTrials.gov (February 2013) and Current Controlled Trials (February 2013). We handsearched the reference lists of the included articles for missed studies.Selection criteria: Only randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing LTME and OTME, reporting at least one of our outcome measures, was considered for inclusion.Data collection and analysis: Two authors independently assessed study quality according to the CONSORT statement, and resolved disagreements by discussion. We rated the quality of the evidence using GRADE methods.Main results: We identified 45 references out of 953 search results, of which 14 studies met the inclusion criteria involving 3528 rectal cancer patients. We did not consider the risk of bias of the included studies to have impacted on the quality of the evidence. Data were analysed according to an intention-to-treat principle with a mean conversion rate of 14.5% (range 0% to 35%) in the laparoscopic group.  There was moderate quality evidence that laparoscopic and open TME had similar effects on five-year disease-free survival (OR 1.02; 95% CI 0.76 to1.38, 4 studies, N = 943). The estimated effects of laparoscopic and open TME on local recurrence and overall survival were similar, although confidence intervals were wide, both with moderate quality evidence (local recurrence: OR 0.89; 95% CI 0.57 to1.39 and overall survival rate: OR 1.15; 95% CI 0.87 to1.52). There was moderate to high quality evidence that the number of resected lymph nodes and surgical margins were similar between the two groups.  For the short-term results, length of hospital stay was reduced by two days (95% CI -3.22 to -1.10), moderate quality evidence), and the time to first defecation was shorter in the LTME group (-0.86 days; 95% CI -1.17 to -0.54). There was moderate quality evidence that 30 days morbidity were similar in both groups (OR 0.94; 95% CI 0.8 to 1.1). There were fewer wound infections (OR 0.68; 95% CI 0.50 to 0.93) and fewer bleeding complications (OR 0.30; 95% CI 0.10 to 0.93) in the LTME group.  There was no clear evidence of any differences in quality of life after LTME or OTME regarding functional recovery, bladder and sexual function. The costs were higher for LTME with differences up to GBP 2000 for direct costs only.Authors' conclusions: We have found moderate quality evidence that laparoscopic total mesorectal excision (TME) has similar effects to open TME on long term survival outcomes for the treatment of rectal cancer. The quality of the evidence was downgraded due to imprecision and further research could impact on our confidence in this result. There is moderate quality evidence that it leads to better short-term post-surgical outcomes in terms of recovery for non-locally advanced rectal cancer. Currently results are consistent in showing a similar disease-free survival and overall survival, and for recurrences after at least three years and up to 10 years, although due to imprecision we cannot rule out superiority of either approach. We await long-term data from a number of ongoing and recently completed studies to contribute to a more robust analysis of long-term disease free, overall survival and local recurrence.US: http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD005200.pub3/abstractRecord #263 of 271ID: CD004730AU: Onady Gary MAU: Stolfi AdrienneTI: Insulin and oral agents for managing cystic fibrosis-related diabetesSO: Cochrane Database of Systematic ReviewsYR: 2016NO: 4PB: John Wiley & Sons, LtdKY: Administration, Oral;Carbamates [administration & dosage];Cystic Fibrosis [complications];Diabetes Mellitus [drug therapy] [etiology];Hyperglycemia [drug therapy];Hypoglycemic Agents [administration & dosage];Insulin [administration & dosage];Insulin Glargine [administration & dosage];Insulin, Isophane [administration & dosage];Piperidines [administration & dosage];Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic;Humans[checkword]CC: CFDOI: 10.1002/14651858.CD004730.pub4AB: Background: The Cystic Fibrosis Foundation recommends both short-term and long-acting insulin therapy when cystic fibrosis-related diabetes has been diagnosed. Diagnosis is based on: an elevated fasting blood glucose level greater than 6.94 mmol/liter (125 mg/deciliter); or oral glucose tolerance tests greater than 11.11 mmol/liter (200 mg/deciliter) at two hours; or symptomatic diabetes for random glucose levels greater than 11.11 mmol/liter (200 mg/deciliter); or glycated hemoglobin levels of at least 6.5%.Objectives: To establish the effectiveness of insulin and oral agents for managing diabetes in people with cystic fibrosis in relation to blood sugar levels, lung function and weight management.Search methods: We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group's Trials Register comprising references identified from comprehensive electronic database searches and handsearches of relevant journals and abstract books of conference proceedings. We also handsearched abstracts from pulmonary symposia and the North American Cystic Fibrosis Conferences.Date of the most recent search of the Group's Cystic Fibrosis Trials Register: 18 February 2016.Selection criteria: Randomized controlled trials comparing all methods of diabetes therapy in people with diagnosed cystic fibrosis-related diabetes.Data collection and analysis: Two authors independently extracted data and assessed the risk of bias in the included studies.Main results: The searches identified 22 trials (34 references). Four trials (200 participants) are included: one short-term single-center trial (n = 7) comparing insulin with oral repaglinide and no medication in people with cystic fibrosis-related diabetes and normal fasting glucose; one long-term multicenter trial (n = 100, 74 of whom had cystic fibrosis-related diabetes) comparing insulin with oral repaglinide and placebo; one long-term multicenter trial (n = 73) comparing insulin with oral repaglinide; and one 12-week single-center trial (n = 20) comparing the long-acting insulin glargine to short-term neutral protamine Hagedorn insulin.Two trials with data for the comparison of insulin to placebo did not report any significant differences between groups for the primary outcomes of blood glucose levels, lung function and nutritional status. This was also true for the single trial with data for the comparison of repaglinide to placebo. Two trials (one lasting one year and one lasting two years) contributed data for the comparison of insulin versus repaglinide. There were no significant differences for the primary outcomes at any time point, except at one year (in the two-year trial) when the insulin group had significant improvement in z score for body mass index compared to the repaglinide group. The single trial comparing glargine to neutral protamine Hagedorn insulin also did not report any significant differences in the review's primary outcomes. A few cases of hypoglycemia were seen in three out of the four trials (none in the longest trial), but these events resolved without further treatment.There was an unclear risk of bias from randomization and allocation concealment in two of the four included trials as the authors did not report any details; in the remaining two studies details for randomization led to a low risk of bias, but only one had sufficient details on allocation concealment to allow a low risk judgement, the second was unclear. There was a high risk from blinding for all trials (except for the comparison of oral repaglinide versus placebo) due to the nature of the interventions. Complete data for all outcomes were not available from any trial leading to a high risk of reporting bias. The amounts of insulin and repaglinide administered were not comparable and this may lead to bias in the results. None of the included trials were powered to show a significant improvement in lung function.Authors' conclusions: This review has not found any significant conclusive evidence that long-acting insulins, short-acting insulins or oral hypoglycemic agents have a distinct advantage over one another in controlling hyperglycemia or clinical outcomes associated with cystic fibrosis-related diabetes. While some cystic fibrosis centers use oral medications to help control diabetes, the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation (USA) clinical practice guidelines support the use of insulin therapy and this remains the most widely-used treatment method. Randomized controlled trials specifically related to controlling diabetes with this impact on the course of pulmonary disease process in cystic fibrosis continue to be a high priority.There is no demonstrated advantage yet established for using oral hypoglycemic agents over insulin, and further trials need to be evaluated to establish whether there is clear benefit for using hypoglycemic agents. Agents that potentiate insulin action, especially agents with additional anti-inflammatory potential should be further investigated to see if there may be a clinical advantage to adding these medications to insulin as adjuvant therapy.US: http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD004730.pub4/abstractRecord #264 of 271ID: CD008366AU: Baker Philip RAAU: Francis Daniel PAU: Soares JesusAU: Weightman Alison LAU: Foster CharlesTI: Community wide interventions for increasing physical activitySO: Cochrane Database of Systematic ReviewsYR: 2015NO: 1PB: John Wiley & Sons, LtdKY: Exercise;Program Development;Cities;Cultural Characteristics;Health Plan Implementation [methods];Health Promotion [methods];Humans[checkword]DOI: 10.1002/14651858.CD008366.pub3AB: Background: Multi-strategic community wide interventions for physical activity are increasingly popular but their ability to achieve population level improvements is unknown.Objectives: To evaluate the effects of community wide, multi-strategic interventions upon population levels of physical activity.Search methods: We searched the Cochrane Public Health Group Segment of the Cochrane Register of Studies,The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, MEDLINE in Process, EMBASE, CINAHL, LILACS, PsycINFO, ASSIA, the British Nursing Index, Chinese CNKI databases, EPPI Centre (DoPHER, TRoPHI), ERIC, HMIC, Sociological Abstracts, SPORTDiscus, Transport Database and Web of Science (Science Citation Index, Social Sciences Citation Index, Conference Proceedings Citation Index). We also scanned websites of the EU Platform on Diet, Physical Activity and Health; Health-Evidence.org; the International Union for Health Promotion and Education; the NIHR Coordinating Centre for Health Technology (NCCHTA); the US Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and NICE and SIGN guidelines. Reference lists of all relevant systematic reviews, guidelines and primary studies were searched and we contacted experts in the field. The searches were updated to 16 January 2014, unrestricted by language or publication status.Selection criteria: Cluster randomised controlled trials, randomised controlled trials, quasi-experimental designs which used a control population for comparison, interrupted time-series studies, and prospective controlled cohort studies were included. Only studies with a minimum six-month follow up from the start of the intervention to measurement of outcomes were included. Community wide interventions had to comprise at least two broad strategies aimed at physical activity for the whole population. Studies which randomised individuals from the same community were excluded.Data collection and analysis: At least two review authors independently extracted the data and assessed the risk of bias. Each study was assessed for the setting, the number of included components and their intensity. The primary outcome measures were grouped according to whether they were dichotomous (per cent physically active, per cent physically active during leisure time, and per cent physically inactive) or continuous (leisure time physical activity time (time spent)), walking (time spent), energy expenditure (as metabolic equivalents or METS)). For dichotomous measures we calculated the unadjusted and adjusted risk difference, and the unadjusted and adjusted relative risk. For continuous measures we calculated percentage change from baseline, unadjusted and adjusted.Main results: After the selection process had been completed, 33 studies were included. A total of 267 communities were included in the review (populations between 500 and 1.9 million). Of the included studies, 25 were set in high income countries and eight were in low income countries. The interventions varied by the number of strategies included and their intensity. Almost all of the interventions included a component of building partnerships with local governments or non-governmental organisations (NGOs) (29 studies). None of the studies provided results by socio-economic disadvantage or other markers of equity. However, of those included studies undertaken in high income countries, 14 studies were described as being provided to deprived, disadvantaged or low socio-economic communities. Nineteen studies were identified as having a high risk of bias, 10 studies were unclear, and four studies had a low risk of bias. Selection bias was a major concern with these studies, with only five studies using randomisation to allocate communities. Four studies were judged as being at low risk of selection bias although 19 studies were considered to have an unclear risk of bias. Twelve studies had a high risk of detection bias, 13 an unclear risk and four a low risk of bias. Generally, the better designed studies showed no improvement in the primary outcome measure of physical activity at a population level.All four of the newly included, and judged to be at low risk of bias, studies (conducted in Japan, United Kingdom and USA) used randomisation to allocate the intervention to the communities. Three studies used a cluster randomised design and one study used a stepped wedge design. The approach to measuring the primary outcome of physical activity was better in these four studies than in many of the earlier studies. One study obtained objective population representative measurements of physical activity by accelerometers, while the remaining three low-risk studies used validated self-reported measures. The study using accelerometry, conducted in low income, high crime communities of USA, emphasised social marketing, partnership with police and environmental improvements. No change in the seven-day average daily minutes of moderate to vigorous physical activity was observed during the two years of operation. Some program level effect was observed with more people walking in the intervention community, however this result was not evident in the whole community. Similarly, the two studies conducted in the United Kingdom (one in rural villages and the other in urban London; both using communication, partnership and environmental strategies) found no improvement in the mean levels of energy expenditure per person per week, measured from one to four years from baseline. None of the three low risk studies reporting a dichotomous outcome of physical activity found improvements associated with the intervention.Overall, there was a noticeable absence of reporting of benefit in physical activity for community wide interventions in the included studies. However, as a group, the interventions undertaken in China appeared to have the greatest possibility of success with high participation rates reported. Reporting bias was evident with two studies failing to report physical activity measured at follow up. No adverse events were reported.The data pertaining to cost and sustainability of the interventions were limited and varied.Authors' conclusions: Although numerous studies have been undertaken, there is a noticeable inconsistency of the findings in the available studies and this is confounded by serious methodological issues within the included studies. The body of evidence in this review does not support the hypothesis that the multi-component community wide interventions studied effectively increased physical activity for the population, although some studies with environmental components observed more people walking.US: http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD008366.pub3/abstractRecord #265 of 271ID: CD006956AU: Dasari Bobby VMAU: McKay DamianAU: Gardiner KeithTI: Laparoscopic versus Open surgery for small bowel Crohn's diseaseSO: Cochrane Database of Systematic ReviewsYR: 2011NO: 1PB: John Wiley & Sons, LtdKY: Crohn Disease [surgery];Intestine, Small [surgery];Laparoscopy [adverse effects] [methods];Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic;Humans[checkword]CC: COLOCADOI: 10.1002/14651858.CD006956.pub2AB: Background: Crohn's disease (CD) is a chronic inflammatory bowel disease that most commonly involves the terminal ileum and colon (55 percent). Surgical treatment is required in approximately 70 percent of patients. Multiple procedures and repeat operations are required in 30 - 70 percent of all patients (Duepree 2002) but the disease remains incurable.Laparoscopy has gained wide acceptance in gastrointestinal surgery with potential advantages of faster return to normal activity and diet, reduced hospital stay, reduced postoperative pain, better cosmesis (Duepree 2002, Dunker 1998, Milsom 2001, Reissman 1996), improved social and sexual interaction (Albaz 2000) and its use is accepted in benign and malignant colorectal diseases. Laparoscopic surgery offers additional advantage of smaller abdominal fascial wounds, low incidence of hernias, and decreased rate of adhesive small-bowel obstruction (Albaz 2000) compared with conventional surgery reducing the need for non-disease-related surgical procedures in CD population.There are concerns about missing occult segments of disease and critical proximal strictures due to limited tactile ability, earlier recurrence due to possible reduced immune response induced by laparoscopy, technical difficulty due to fragile inflamed bowel and mesentery and the existence of adhesions, fistulas, and abscesses (Uchikoshi 2004). It is therefore important to evaluate the potential benefits and risks of laparoscopic surgery versus open surgery in patients with small bowel CD (Lowney 2005).Objectives: To determine if there is a difference in the perioperative outcomes and re-operation rates for disease recurrence following laparoscopic surgery compared to open surgery in small bowel CD.Search methods: Published and unpublished randomised controlled trials were searched for in the following electronic databases:   The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) 2010 issue 2   The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, and Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects (DARE) 2010 issue 2   The Cochrane Colorectal Cancer Group Controlled Trials Register   Ovid MEDLINE (1990 to 2010)   EMBASE (1990 to 2010)   Health Technology Assessment (HTA) Database (1990 to 2010)Selection criteria: Randomised controlled trials (RCT) comparing laparoscopic and open surgery for small bowel CD were included.Data collection and analysis: Two reviewers independently assessed the studies and extracted data. RevMan 5.0 was used for statistical analysis.Main results: Two RCTs comparing laparoscopic and open surgery for small bowel CD were identified. Long term outcomes of the patients in both the trials were published separately and these were included in the review.Laparoscopic surgery appeared to be associated with reduced number of wound infections (1/61 vs 9/59), reoperation rates for non disease related complications (3/57 vs 7/54 ) but the difference was not statistically significant [p values were 0.23 and 0.19 respectively]. There was no statistically significant difference between any of the compared outcomes between laparoscopic and open surgery in the management of small bowel CD.Authors' conclusions: Laparoscopic surgery for small bowel CD may be as safe as the open operation. There was no significant difference in the perioperative outcomes and the long term reoperation rates for disease-related or non-disease related complications of CD.US: http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD006956.pub2/abstractRecord #266 of 271ID: CD002008AU: Baldwin ChristineAU: Weekes Christine ElizabethTI: Dietary advice with or without oral nutritional supplements for disease-related malnutrition in adultsSO: Cochrane Database of Systematic ReviewsYR: 2011NO: 9PB: John Wiley & Sons, LtdKY: Dietary Supplements;Dietetics;Body Weight [physiology];Dietary Services;Disease;Malnutrition [diet therapy] [etiology] [mortality];Nutritional Physiological Phenomena [physiology];Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic;Adult[checkword];Humans[checkword]DOI: 10.1002/14651858.CD002008.pub4AB: Background: Disease-related malnutrition has been reported in 10% to 55% of people in hospital and the community. Dietary advice encouraging the use of energy- and nutrient-rich foods rather than oral nutritional supplements has been suggested as the initial approach for managing disease-related malnutrition.Objectives: To examine evidence that dietary advice in adults with disease-related malnutrition improves survival, weight and anthropometry; to estimate the size of any additional effect of nutritional supplements combined with dietary advice and to compare the effects of dietary advice with oral nutritional supplements.Search methods: Relevant publications were identified from comprehensive electronic database searches and handsearching.Last search: 14 February 2010.Selection criteria: Randomised controlled trials of dietary advice with or without oral nutritional supplements in people with disease-related malnutrition in any health-care setting compared with no advice, oral nutritional supplements or dietary advice given alone.Data collection and analysis: Two authors independently assessed trial eligibility, risk of bias and extracted data.Main results: Forty-five studies (3186 participants) met the inclusion criteria; (dietary advice compared with: no advice (1053 participants); with oral nutritional supplements (332 participants); with dietary advice and oral nutritional supplements (731 participants); and dietary advice plus oral nutritional supplements compared with no additional intervention (1070 participants). Follow-up ranged from 18 days to 24 months. No comparison showed a significant difference between groups for mortality or morbidity. There was a significant change in weight found between groups when comparing dietary advice to no advice for interventions lasting greater than 12 months, mean difference 3.75 kg (95% confidence interval 0.97 to 6.53), and when all studies were combined, mean difference 1.47 kg (95% confidence interval 0.32 to 2.61) although there was significant heterogeneity in the combined analysis (I2 = 90%). Similar improvements in weight were found for the comparison of dietary advice with nutritional supplements if required versus no advice, mean difference 2.20 kg (95% confidence interval 1.16 to 3.25). Dietary advice compared with no advice was also associated with significantly improved mid-arm muscle circumference when all studies were combined, but with moderate heterogeneity, mean difference 0.81 mm (95% confidence interval 0.31 to 1.31). Dietary advice given with nutritional supplements compared with dietary advice alone resulted in improvements in: mid-arm muscle circumference, mean difference -0.89 mm (95% confidence interval -1.35 to -0.43); triceps skinfold thickness, mean difference -1.22 mm (95% confidence interval -2.34 to -0.09); and grip strength, mean difference -1.67 kg (95% confidence interval -2.96 to -0.37), although the effects on triceps skinfold thickness and grip strength were heterogeneous. Dietary advice with supplements if required resulted in a significant increase in triceps skinfold thickness compared with no advice, mean difference 0.40 mm (95% confidence interval 0.10 to 0.70), although these results are from a single trial with only 29 participants.Authors' conclusions: Evidence of variable quality suggests that dietary advice with or without oral nutritional supplements may improve weight, body composition and grip strength. We found no evidence of benefit of dietary advice or oral nutritional supplements given alone or in combination on survival. Studies addressing the impact of nutritional interventions on nutritional, functional and patient-centred outcomes are needed.US: http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD002008.pub4/abstractRecord #267 of 271ID: CD003094AU: Reveiz LudovicAU: Gyte Gillian MLAU: Cuervo Luis GabrielAU: Casasbuenas AlexandraTI: Treatments for iron-deficiency anaemia in pregnancySO: Cochrane Database of Systematic ReviewsYR: 2011NO: 10PB: John Wiley & Sons, LtdKY: Anemia, Iron-Deficiency [therapy];Injections, Intramuscular;Injections, Intravenous;Iron Compounds [administration & dosage] [adverse effects];Pregnancy Complications, Hematologic [therapy];Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic;Female[checkword];Humans[checkword];Pregnancy[checkword]CC: PREGDOI: 10.1002/14651858.CD003094.pub3AB: Background: Iron deficiency, the most common cause of anaemia in pregnancy worldwide, can be mild, moderate or severe. Severe anaemia can have very serious consequences for mothers and babies, but there is controversy about whether treating mild or moderate anaemia provides more benefit than harm.Objectives: To assess the effects of different treatments for anaemia in pregnancy attributed to iron deficiency (defined as haemoglobin less than 11 g/dL or other equivalent parameters) on maternal and neonatal morbidity and mortality.Search methods: We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (7 June 2011), CENTRAL (2011, Issue 5), PubMed (1966 to June 2011), the International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) (2 May 2011), Health Technology Assessment Program (HTA) (2 May 2011) and LATINREC (Colombia) (2 May 2011).Selection criteria: Randomised controlled trials comparing treatments for anaemia in pregnancy attributed to iron deficiency.Data collection and analysis: We identified 23 trials, involving 3.198 women. We assessed their risk of bias. Three further studies identified are awaiting classification.Main results: Many of the trials were from low-income countries; they were generally small and frequently methodologically poor. They covered a very wide range of differing drugs, doses and routes of administration, making it difficult to pool data. Oral iron in pregnancy showed a reduction in the incidence of anaemia (risk ratio 0.38, 95% confidence interval 0.26 to 0.55, one trial, 125 women) and better haematological indices than placebo (two trials). It was not possible to assess the effects of treatment by severity of anaemia. A trend was found between dose and reported adverse effects. Most trials reported no clinically relevant outcomes nor adverse effects. Although the intramuscular and intravenous routes produced better haematological indices in women than the oral route, no clinical outcomes were assessed and there were insufficient data on adverse effects, for example, on venous thrombosis and severe allergic reactions. Daily low-dose iron supplements may be effective at treating anaemia in pregnancy with less gastrointestinal side effects compared with higher doses.Authors' conclusions: Despite the high incidence and burden of disease associated with this condition, there is a paucity of good quality trials assessing clinical maternal and neonatal effects of iron administration in women with anaemia. Daily oral iron treatment improves haematological indices but causes frequent gastrointestinal adverse effects. Parenteral (intramuscular and intravenous) iron enhances haematological response, compared with oral iron, but there are concerns about possible important adverse effects (for intravenous treatment venous thrombosis and allergic reactions and for intramuscular treatment important pain, discolouration and allergic reactions). Large, good quality trials, assessing clinical outcomes (including adverse effects) as well as the effects of treatment by severity of anaemia are required.US: http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD003094.pub3/abstractRecord #268 of 271ID: CD002854AU: Farina NicolasAU: Llewellyn DavidAU: Isaac Mokhtar Gad El Kareem NasrAU: Tabet NajiTI: Vitamin E for Alzheimer's dementia and mild cognitive impairmentSO: Cochrane Database of Systematic ReviewsYR: 2017NO: 1PB: John Wiley & Sons, LtdKY: Alzheimer Disease [drug therapy];Antioxidants [therapeutic use];Cognitive Dysfunction [drug therapy];Disease Progression;Outcome Assessment (Health Care);Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic;Vitamin E [therapeutic use];Humans[checkword]DOI: 10.1002/14651858.CD002854.pub4AB: Background: Vitamin E occurs naturally in the diet. It has several biological activities, including functioning as an antioxidant to scavenge toxic free radicals. Evidence that free radicals may contribute to the pathological processes behind cognitive impairment has led to interest in the use of vitamin E supplements to treat mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer's disease (AD). This is an update of a Cochrane Review first published in 2000, and previously updated in 2006 and 2012.Objectives: To assess the efficacy of vitamin E in the treatment of MCI and dementia due to AD.Search methods: We searched the Specialized Register of the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group (ALOIS), the Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, CINAHL, LILACS as well as many trials databases and grey literature sources on 22 April 2016 using the terms: "Vitamin E", vitamin-E, alpha-tocopherol.Selection criteria: We included all double-blind, randomised trials in which treatment with any dose of vitamin E was compared with placebo in people with AD or MCI.Data collection and analysis: We used standard methodological procedures according to the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions. We rated the quality of the evidence using the GRADE approach. Where appropriate we attempted to contact authors to obtain missing information.Main results: Four trials met the inclusion criteria, but we could only extract outcome data in accordance with our protocol from two trials, one in an AD population (n = 304) and one in an MCI population (n = 516). Both trials had an overall low to unclear risk of bias. It was not possible to pool data across studies owing to a lack of comparable outcome measures.In people with AD, we found no evidence of any clinically important effect of vitamin E on cognition, measured with change from baseline in the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale - Cognitive subscale (ADAS-Cog) over six to 48 months (mean difference (MD) -1.81, 95% confidence interval (CI) -3.75 to 0.13, P = 0.07, 1 study, n = 272; moderate quality evidence). There was no evidence of a difference between vitamin E and placebo groups in the risk of experiencing at least one serious adverse event over six to 48 months (risk ratio (RR) 0.86, 95% CI 0.71 to 1.05, P = 0.13, 1 study, n = 304; moderate quality evidence), or in the risk of death (RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.52 to 1.34, P = 0.46, 1 study, n = 304; moderate quality evidence). People with AD receiving vitamin E showed less functional decline on the Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study/Activities of Daily Living Inventory than people receiving placebo at six to 48 months (mean difference (MD) 3.15, 95% CI 0.07 to 6.23, P = 0.04, 1 study, n = 280; moderate quality evidence). There was no evidence of any clinically important effect on neuropsychiatric symptoms measured with the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (MD -1.47, 95% CI -4.26 to 1.32, P = 0.30, 1 study, n = 280; moderate quality evidence).We found no evidence that vitamin E affected the probability of progression from MCI to probable dementia due to AD over 36 months (RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.79 to 1.35, P = 0.81, 1 study, n = 516; moderate quality evidence). Five deaths occurred in each of the vitamin E and placebo groups over the 36 months (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.30 to 3.44, P = 0.99, 1 study, n = 516; moderate quality evidence). We were unable to extract data in accordance with the review protocol for other outcomes. However, the study authors found no evidence that vitamin E differed from placebo in its effect on cognitive function, global severity or activities of daily living . There was also no evidence of a difference between groups in the more commonly reported adverse events.Authors' conclusions: We found no evidence that the alpha-tocopherol form of vitamin E given to people with MCI prevents progression to dementia, or that it improves cognitive function in people with MCI or dementia due to AD. However, there is moderate quality evidence from a single study that it may slow functional decline in AD. Vitamin E was not associated with an increased risk of serious adverse events or mortality in the trials in this review. These conclusions have changed since the previous update, however they are still based on small numbers of trials and participants and further research is quite likely to affect the results.US: http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD002854.pub4/abstractRecord #269 of 271ID: CD005937AU: Oladapo Olufemi TAU: Fawole BukolaTI: Treatments for suppression of lactationSO: Cochrane Database of Systematic ReviewsYR: 2012NO: 9PB: John Wiley & Sons, LtdKY: Bromocriptine [therapeutic use];Estrogens [therapeutic use];Hormone Antagonists [therapeutic use];Lactation [drug effects] [physiology];Milk Ejection [drug effects] [physiology];Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic;Female[checkword];Humans[checkword]DOI: 10.1002/14651858.CD005937.pub3AB: Background: Various pharmacologic and non-pharmacologic interventions have been used to suppress lactation after childbirth and relieve associated symptoms. Despite the large volume of literature on the subject, there is currently no universal guideline on the most appropriate approach for suppressing lactation in postpartum women.Objectives: To evaluate the effectiveness and safety of interventions used for suppression of lactation in postpartum women (who have not breastfed or expressed breastmilk) to determine which approach has the greatest comparative benefits with least risk.Search methods: We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (30 June 2012).Selection criteria: Randomised trials evaluating the effectiveness of treatments used for suppression of postpartum lactation.Data collection and analysis: Two review authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data.Main results: We included 62 trials (6428 women). Twenty-two trials did not contribute data to the meta-analyses. The trials were generally small and of limited quality. Three trials (107 women) indicated that bromocriptine significantly reduced the proportion of women lactating compared with no treatment at or within seven days postpartum (three trials, 107 women; risk ratio (RR) 0.36, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.24 to 0.54). Seven trials involving oestrogen preparations (diethylstilbestrol, quinestrol, chlorotrianisene, hexestrol) suggested that they significantly reduced the proportion of lactating women compared with no treatment at or within seven days postpartum (RR 0.40, 95% CI 0.29 to 0.56). We found no trials comparing non-pharmacologic methods with no treatment. Trials comparing bromocriptine with other pharmacologic agents such as methergoline, prostaglandins, pyridoxine, carbegoline, diethylstilbestrol and cyclofenil suggested similarity in their effectiveness. Side effects were poorly reported in the trials and no case of thromboembolism was recorded in the four trials that reported it as an outcome.Authors' conclusions: There is weak evidence that some pharmacologic treatments (most of which are currently unavailable to the public) are better than no treatment for suppressing lactation symptoms in the first postpartum week. No evidence currently exists to indicate whether non-pharmacologic approaches are more effective than no treatment. Presently, there is insufficient evidence to address the side effects of methods employed for suppressing lactation. When women desire treatment, bromocriptine may be considered where it is registered for lactation suppression in those without predisposition to its major side effects of public concerns. Many trials did not contribute data that could be included in analyses. Large randomised trials are needed to compare the effectiveness of pharmacologic (especially bromocriptine) and non-pharmacologic methods with no treatment. Such trials should consider the acceptability of the intervention and lactation symptoms of concern to women and be large enough to detect clinically important differences in major side effects between comparison groups.US: http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD005937.pub3/abstractRecord #270 of 271ID: CD010899AU: Bell Jennifer MAU: Shields Michael DAU: Watters JanetAU: Hamilton AlistairAU: Beringer TimothyAU: Elliott MarkAU: Quinlivan RosalineAU: Tirupathi SandyaAU: Blackwood BronaghTI: Interventions to prevent and treat corticosteroid-induced osteoporosis and prevent osteoporotic fractures in Duchenne muscular dystrophySO: Cochrane Database of Systematic ReviewsYR: 2017NO: 1PB: John Wiley & Sons, LtdDOI: 10.1002/14651858.CD010899.pub2AB: Background: Corticosteroid treatment is considered the 'gold standard' for Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD); however, it is also known to induce osteoporosis and thus increase the risk of vertebral fragility fractures. Good practice in the care of those with DMD requires prevention of these adverse effects. Treatments to increase bone mineral density include bisphosphonates and vitamin D and calcium supplements, and in adolescents with pubertal delay, testosterone. Bone health management is an important part of lifelong care for patients with DMD.Objectives: To assess the effects of interventions to prevent or treat osteoporosis in children and adults with DMD taking long-term corticosteroids; to assess the effects of these interventions on the frequency of vertebral fragility fractures and long-bone fractures, and on quality of life; and to assess adverse events.Search methods: On 12 September 2016, we searched the Cochrane Neuromuscular Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, and CINAHL Plus to identify potentially eligible trials. We also searched the Web of Science ISI Proceedings (2001 to September 2016) and three clinical trials registries to identify unpublished studies and ongoing trials. We contacted correspondence authors of the included studies in the review to obtain information on unpublished studies or work in progress.Selection criteria: We considered for inclusion in the review randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs involving any bone health intervention for corticosteroid-induced osteoporosis and fragility fractures in children, adolescents, and adults with a confirmed diagnosis of DMD. The interventions might have included oral and intravenous bisphosphonates, vitamin D supplements, calcium supplements, dietary calcium, testosterone, and weight-bearing activity.Data collection and analysis: Two review authors independently assessed reports and selected potential studies for inclusion, following standard Cochrane methodology. We contacted study authors to obtain further information for clarification on published work, unpublished studies, and work in progress.Main results: We identified 18 potential studies, of which two, currently reported only as abstracts, met the inclusion criteria for this review. Too little information was available for us to present full results or adequately assess risk of bias. The participants were children aged five to 15 years with DMD, ambulant and non-ambulant. The interventions were risedronate versus no treatment in one trial (13 participants) and whole-body vibration versus a placebo device in the second (21 participants). Both studies reported improved bone mineral density with the active treatments, with no improvement in the control groups, but the abstracts did not compare treatment and control conditions. All children tolerated whole-body vibration treatment. No study provided information on adverse events. Two studies are ongoing: one investigating whole-body vibration, the other investigating zoledronic acid.Authors' conclusions: We know of no high-quality evidence from RCTs to guide use of treatments to prevent or treat corticosteroid-induced osteoporosis and reduce the risk of fragility fractures in children and adults with DMD; only limited results from two trials reported in abstracts were available. We await formal trial reports. Findings from two ongoing relevant studies and two trials, for which only abstracts are available, will be important in future updates of this review.US: http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD010899.pub2/abstractRecord #271 of 271ID: CD011112AU: Perry AlisonAU: Lee Siew HwaAU: Cotton SusanAU: Kennedy CatrionaTI: Therapeutic exercises for affecting post-treatment swallowing in people treated for advanced-stage head and neck cancersSO: Cochrane Database of Systematic ReviewsYR: 2016NO: 8PB: John Wiley & Sons, LtdKY: Deglutition;Myofunctional Therapy;Chemoradiotherapy;Deglutition Disorders [etiology] [therapy];Head and Neck Neoplasms [pathology] [therapy];Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic;Adult[checkword];Aged[checkword];Aged, 80 and over[checkword];Female[checkword];Humans[checkword];Male[checkword];Middle Aged[checkword]DOI: 10.1002/14651858.CD011112.pub2AB: Background: Head and neck cancer treatment has developed over the last decade, with improved mortality and survival rates, but the treatments often result in dysphagia (a difficulty in swallowing) as a side effect. This may be acute, resolving after treatment, or remain as a long-term negative sequela of head and neck cancer (HNC) treatment. Interventions to counteract the problems associated with dysphagia include swallowing exercises or modification of diet (bolus texture, size), or both.Objectives: To determine the effects of therapeutic exercises, undertaken before, during and/or immediately after HNC treatment, on swallowing, aspiration and adverse events such as chest infections, aspiration pneumonia and profound weight loss, in people treated curatively for advanced-stage (stage III, stage IV) squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck.Search methods: The Cochrane ENT Information Specialist searched the ENT Trials Register; Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL 2016, Issue 6); MEDLINE; PubMed; Embase; CINAHL; LILACS; KoreaMed; IndMed; PakMediNet; Web of Science; ClinicalTrials.gov; ICTRP; speechBITE; Google Scholar; Google and additional sources for published and unpublished trials. The date of the search was 1 July 2016.Selection criteria: We selected randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of adults with head and neck cancer (stage III, stage IV) who underwent therapeutic exercises for swallowing before, during and/or immediately after HNC treatment to help produce safe and efficient swallowing. The main comparison was therapeutic exercises versus treatment as usual (TAU). Other possible comparison pairs included: therapeutic exercises versus sham exercises and therapeutic exercises plus TAU versus TAU. TAU consisted of reactive management of a patient's dysphagia, when this occurred. When severe, this included insertion of either a percutaneous endoscopic gastroscopy or nasogastric tube for non-oral feeding.Data collection and analysis: We used the standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. Our primary outcomes were: safety and efficiency of oral swallowing, as measured by reduced/no aspiration; oropharyngeal swallowing efficiency (OPSE) measures, taken from videofluoroscopy swallowing studies; and adverse events, such as chest infections, aspiration pneumonia and profound weight loss. Secondary outcomes were time to return to function (swallowing); self-reported changes to quality of life; changes to psychological well-being - depression, anxiety and stress; patient satisfaction with the intervention; patient compliance with the intervention; and cost-effectiveness of the intervention.Main results: We included six studies (reported as seven papers) involving 326 participants whose ages ranged from 39 to 83 years, with a gender bias towards men (73% to 95% across studies), reflecting the characteristics of patients with HNC. The risk of bias in the studies was generally high.We did not pool data from studies because of significant differences in the interventions and outcomes evaluated. We found a lack of standardisation and consistency in the outcomes measured and the endpoints at which they were evaluated.We found no evidence that therapeutic exercises were better than TAU, or any other treatment, in improving the safety and efficiency of oral swallowing (our primary outcome) or in improving any of the secondary outcomes.Using the GRADE system, we classified the overall quality of the evidence for each outcome as very low, due to the limited number of trials and their low quality. There were no adverse events reported that were directly attributable to the intervention (swallowing exercises).Authors' conclusions: We found no evidence that undertaking therapeutic exercises before, during and/or immediately after HNC treatment leads to improvement in oral swallowing. This absence of evidence may be due to the small participant numbers in trials, resulting in insufficient power to detect any difference. Data from the identified trials could not be combined due to differences in the choice of primary outcomes and in the measurement tools used to assess them, and the differing baseline and endpoints across studies.Designing and implementing studies with stronger methodological rigour is essential. There needs to be agreement about the key primary outcomes, the choice of validated assessment tools to measure them and the time points at which those measurements are made.US: http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD011112.pub2/abstract
